0,"we are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system , ubswenergy , is ready for launch on the week of feb . 11 , which is the week following the anticipated enron / ubs closing date of friday , feb . 8 .
to assist in this process , we are planning an online trading simulation for thursday , february 7 from 0900 to 1100 ( cst ) . it is planned to include all traders , originators , mid / back - office staff and it teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading .
purpose of the simulation - the simulation will test our "" live "" trading environment ( restricted to internal access only ) and will :
test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes ( including credit , risk , legal , operations , etc . )
provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to ubs staff visiting next week
nature of the simulation - the simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid / back - office functions :
credit , legal , risk , operations , and other groups :
profile tests for "" external "" customers ( role - played by originators )
profile tests for internal users ( traders , back - office , etc . )
data and process checking as completed transactions flow through mid / back - office systems
traders and originators :
traders will be managing their individual books and associated products . although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day , both physical and financial will be available during the simulation . each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation .
originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties . credit limits , etc . will be tested during the simulation .
information technology :
will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation .
after the simulation is over , will work with the relevant groups to test the trade - data in various systems and risk books
will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete .
next steps
traders and originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system .
originators will be assigned specific roles . you should expect to receive an email and / or handout on or before wednesday , feb . 6 .
ubswenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation .
summary
this simulation is an important step towards re - launching our trading business . we appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of ubs warburg energy and the ubswenergy trading platform .

health through the decree published in this wednesday escapenumber in the official union diary i think that everybody loses patients and the country as well said the executive he comments that the news was a surprise for the company because they were in the middle of a negotiation process with the brazilian government and reaffirmed the unequivocal commitment of merck to try to find a solution for aids however he highlights that to keep doing research is important to have a safe environment for investment and a return for the shareholders and for the people who are investing in this way read the full interview agência aids what is merck' position about the decree published today in the official diary declaring the public interest of efavirenz joão sanches it was a surprise for us because we are still in a process and we understand that we are in the middle of a negotiation process i don´t have a lot to say because we are exactly in the middle of the process from our point of view we are sure and expect that the brazilian government does not issue the compulsory license because we do not believe that this is a solution neither for patients nor society and neither for the country nor for the pharmaceutical industry as a whole agência aids according to the decree one of the reasons for the government taking this action was the fact that no agreement was achieved with merck for the price the government proposal was the adoption of the price set in thailand of us escapenumber escapenumber and the merck' proposal was a discount of escapenumber of the current price which is us escapenumber escapenumber why such a small reduction why the industry is so intransigent in the negotiations joão sanches i think it is important to look at the historical process of this discussion in escapenumber we gave two discounts to the ministry a discount of escapenumber and right after because of a negotiation we gave an additional discount of escapenumber as we recognize that brazil is a country with an excellent treatment aids program and that give access to all patients because all our policy is corporate it is global and based on access as a result of these two discounts the efavirenz's price in brazil is the lowest in the world and is still currently the lowest all over the world for countries which have medium hdi human develoment index and prevalence lower than escapenumber which is the case of brazil that is classified in the global access policy established by merck together with other pharmaceutical companies and the united nations world health organization and world bank these criteria were not set by us it is a criteria of common agreement the second thing i can tell you is that the price of efavirenz in brazil since it was launched in escapenumber had a reduction of escapenumber so i think that when you ask me this question we are looking at a certain time isolating it from the historical fact efavirenz's price is today the lowest among the other anti retrovirals bought by the national std aids program escapenumber of the patients use stocrin brand name for efavirenz but it represents only escapenumber of the total cost of the program agência aids in an interview to the agência an activist said that pharmaceutical industry should be more transparent should show their real costs for medicines he said that if companies spent less money with marketing and publicity it would be possible to reduce the medicines prices and make it affordable for those who need why the industry does do that joão sanches i don´t have any comment to make about this declaration because the figures of pharmaceutical companies such as merck are published and are public and the balance follows the parameters of sound accountancy what i think people usually forget for example is the commitment that we have had for escapenumber years to research innovative medicines and that the first anti retroviral comes from merck sharp dohme researches research is in the long term and we keeping researching vaccines until now we have two candidates in trials for a vaccine against hiv aids our commitment is to undoubtly find a solution for this disease but to keep doing this research it is important that we have a safety environment for investment and have a return for shareholders and for people that in any way are investing for that agência aids considering what aids represents today in the world don't you think that it is the moment for pharmaceutical companies have a different policy for aids medicines joão sanches do you know our global access policy it already does that i will summarize it for you the global access policy set together with world bank united nations organization unaids who and some pharmaceutical companies established two criterias hdi and prevalence of adult population among that there are three categories of countries the first one which usually are developed countries have high hdi and prevalence lower than escapenumber there is a second group where brazil is included which are countries with medium hdi and prevalence lower than escapenumber for adult population in this price range brazil has the lowest price and the third range which include all subsaarian african countries which have the low hdi and prevalence more than escapenumber why the prevalence because it means the cost for society and for health systems of these countries to treat hiv aids in the case of botswana escapenumber of the adult population are infected by hiv aids it is impossible to compare botswana and brazil where the prevalence of the lattest is of escapenumber escapenumber and the hdi are totally different so according to these categories we have a global price policy for example in countries with medium hdi and prevalence below escapenumber such as brazil efavirenz's price is us escapenumber escapenumber in brazil the price is us escapenumber escapenumber agência aids up to where does merck intend to go in the negotiation with the government so that it doesn´t bear the burden of the responsibility for the issuance of a compulsory license joão sanches usually we understand that we are committed and will keep negotiating with the brazilian government we believe that the compulsory license is not the best solution now what i would like to contribute is that all this discussion is always looking from one side which is from the pharmaceutical industry it is not only pharmaceutical industry or merck those who lose i think everybody lose patients lose and the country also lose

0,http thehill com leading the news sen sanders renews push on drug pricing bill escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber html sen sanders renews push on drug pricing bill david mikhail may escapenumber escapenumber the hill sen bernie sanders i vt introduced legislation yesterday that seeks to reinstate a provision known as the reasonable pricing clause which would provide the government price negotiating authority for drugs that are developed with federal funding the measure was filed as an amendment to another prescription drug bill according to sanders spokesman mike briggs with the provisions history of acquiring significant cross party support and the populist character of the legislation the sanders measure provides democrats their best chance of sending a prescription drug price control measure to the white house paving the way for what could be president bushs third veto sanders said that the lack of the provision has helped create the situation where americans are paying the highest drug prices in the world while americans pay for research the pharmaceutical drug industry receives a discount  he went on to blast the drug industry lobby calling it the most powerful lobbying force in the capital and attributing the repeal of the clause in escapenumber to its efforts but while the gop is linked with the pharmaceutical industry it was a democrat in the white house who was responsible for the policy change in an effort to use federal funding to overcome barriers to drug development the reasonable pricing clause was adopted in escapenumber and was required for drugs that were collaboratively developed with the national institutes of health nih under exclusive licensing agreements the clinton administration ultimately repealed the provision after the nih convened two panels found that the clause undermined the speed with which pharmaceutical drugs were developed sanders initiated several attempts for the provisions return as a member of the house including an effort in escapenumber when he introduced renewal legislation as an amendment to the health appropriations bill in spite of the republican controlled congress the measure passed the house garnering escapenumber republican votes over half of the house gop delegation yet was stripped from the final bill during conference committee according to the senator a notable no vote came from former congressman billy tauzin r la head of the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma rep dana rohrabacher r calif a supporter of the provision plans on supporting new

authority for drugs distributed under the medicare part d program with help from the white house republicans leaders in the senate torpedoed that bill in a cloture vote three weeks ago most believe bush will likewise oppose the sanders measure the white houses statement of administration policy on the part d bill echoes the criticism of the reasonable pricing clause that such a price control would impede competition and undermine drug development efforts however the sanders bill  unlike the part d legislation  has a reasonable chance to attract escapenumber votes in addition to the five republican senators who broke rank with the party to vote for cloture on the part d bill two gop senators tom coburn r okla and john thune r s d voted in favor of the sanders measure in escapenumber as members of the house both offices did not respond to calls for comment ken johnson senior vice president for phrma issued a statement denouncing the sanders measure offering a hint into future lobbying efforts against the bill clearly policies such as the reasonable pricing clause disincentivize collaborative research that helps patients live longer healthier lives  sanders dismissed the

to another prescription drug bill according to sanders spokesman mike briggs with the provisions history of acquiring significant cross party support and the populist character of the legislation the sanders measure provides democrats their best chance of sending a prescription drug price control measure to the white house paving the way for what could be president bushs third veto sanders said that the lack of the provision has helped create the situation where americans are paying the highest drug prices in the world while americans pay for research the pharmaceutical drug industry receives a discount  he went on to blast the drug industry lobby calling it the most powerful lobbying force in the capital and attributing the repeal of the clause in escapenumber to its efforts but while the gop is linked with the pharmaceutical industry it was a democrat in the white house who was responsible for the policy change in an effort to use federal funding to overcome barriers to drug development the reasonable pricing clause was adopted in escapenumber and was required for drugs that were collaboratively developed with the national institutes of health nih under exclusive licensing agreements the clinton administration ultimately repealed the provision after the nih convened two panels found that the clause undermined the speed with which pharmaceutical drugs were developed sanders initiated several attempts for the provisions return as a member of the house including an effort in escapenumber when he introduced A legislação renovativa como uma emenda ao

subject : ees / epmi split
i heard dave ' s voicemail . i appreciate his concern . however , i don ' t think that the delineation is easy to do . i am confident that my team knows what we are good at and what we aren ' t good at . if we aren ' t best suited to serve the load , we will act like "" one enron "" and send the account over to the them . the split should really be driven by the customer ' s needs and which utility they are behind . for example , montana power has a wonderful balancing tariff where the utility looks at the scheduled volume and compares it to the actual volumes and settles directly with the customer for imbalances . we don ' t do any metering , we don ' t do any unique billing , the loads range anywhere from 1 mw to 25 mw . ena is definitely best suited to serve these industrials because commodity price is their top interest . the pugest system is about to open up with a structure that is similar to montana ' s . ena will be very well positioned to serve this load . the same company could have a plant in california . we wouldn ' t serve that load because the expertise needed to manage the ctc risk ( before this thing blew up anyway ) , the challenge of metering and tracking metered volumes on a schedule vs . actual basis , and the load forecasting . the same company could also own gas stations in the west . we have no interest in serving gas stations .
i also heard the message attached to dave ' s from scott dann ( sp ? ) . his message did little to open communication between groups . he provided no details on what the issue was in the west with respect to epmi ( ena ) and ees . for us to do this right , ees and ena need to be able to solve problems without involving the office of the chair of each company . i would be happy to work with anyone from ees to resolve who should be covering which accounts .
i still can ' t think of a clean way to divide customers . each approach has its problems . each company ( ees and ena ) has its strengths . our strength is commodity pricing and delivering a mw to anywhere on the western grid . their strength is in tariff analysis , energy management , and aggregating loads .
for the west , i am confident that chris calger and i can sort out any disputes with ees that are reasonable . we know what we are good at . we have a proven track record with a large number of industrials in the west . i still believe that our customers and shareholders are best served with our favored approach . it will require better communication on the operating level between ees and ena .","Apenas para adicionar à nota de Tim - sugiro que o número de problemas de sobreposição seria poucos e distantes entre e pode ser resolvido no nível operacional Eu acho que a ENA pode oferecer representantes de cada região que têm uma linha aberta de comunicação com as pessoas apropriadas do EES Se a ENA e o EES fornecerem uma pequena lista de contatos, não deve haver necessidade de lidar com isso no nível OTC Por exemplo, Chris Foster (ENA West Power Mid Market) direcionaria questões / oportunidades para EES e chamadas de campo de pessoas que olham para acordos no Western Power Market Lista de interface da ENA:

Assunto: divisão EES / EPMI
Eu ouvi o correio de voz de Dave Agradeço a preocupação dele No entanto, não acho que o delineamento seja fácil de fazer Estou confiante de que minha equipe sabe em que somos bons e no que não somos Se não formos mais adequados para servir a carga, agiremos como ""One Enron"" e enviaremos a conta para eles A divisão deve realmente ser motivada pelas necessidades do cliente e qual utilidade eles estão atrás Por exemplo, Montana Power tem uma tarifa maravilhosa de equilíbrio, onde a concessionária analisa o volume programado e o compara aos volumes reais e se estabelece diretamente com o cliente para desequilíbrios Não fazemos nenhuma medição, não fazemos nenhuma cobrança única, as cargas variam de 1 mW a 25 MW A ENA é definitivamente mais adequada para servir a esses industriais, porque o preço da commodities é o seu principal interesse O sistema pugest está prestes a se abrir com uma estrutura semelhante à de Montana Ena estará muito bem posicionado para servir esta carga A mesma empresa poderia ter uma planta na Califórnia Não serviríamos a essa carga porque a experiência necessária para gerenciar o risco de CTC (antes que isso explodisse de qualquer maneira), o desafio de medir e rastrear volumes medidos em um cronograma vs base real e a previsão de carga A mesma empresa também poderia possuir postos de gasolina no oeste Não temos interesse em servir postos de gasolina Eu também ouvi a mensagem anexada a Dave de Scott Dann (sp?) Sua mensagem fez pouco para abrir a comunicação entre os grupos Ele não forneceu detalhes sobre qual era a questão no Ocidente em relação à EPMI (ENA) e EES Para nós fazer isso direito, EES e ENA precisam ser capazes de resolver problemas sem envolver o escritório do presidente de cada empresa Eu ficaria feliz em trabalhar com qualquer pessoa de EES para resolver quem deveria estar cobrindo quais contas Eu ainda não consigo pensar em uma maneira limpa de dividir os clientes Cada abordagem tem seus problemas Cada empresa (EES e ENA) tem seus pontos fortes Nossa força é preços de commodities e entregar um MW para qualquer lugar da grade ocidental Sua força é em análise tarifária, gerenciamento de energia e cargas agregadas Para o Ocidente, estou confiante de que Chris Calger e posso resolver quaisquer disputas com EES que são razoáveis Sabemos no que somos bons Temos um histórico comprovado com um grande número de industriais no oeste Eu ainda acredito que nossos clientes e acionistas são melhor servidos com nossa abordagem favorita Exigirá uma melhor comunicação no nível operacional entre EES e ENA "

i ' m not sure who was going to handle this project - tom moore or laine
borgman . so , by this e - mail , i will ask the appropriate person to respond to
you . i have also given tom ' s name and e - mail address to ms . geman .
they will just need to change in article 17 of the software license agreement
the response time from 2 to 3 days and the software license part should be
done . the only thing that would leave then is ms . geman ' s response regarding
the escrow agreement as to whether it was agreeable to her and her law firm
( who would be holding the source code in escrow ) . i ' m not sure whether ms .
geman has responded to tom about that or not . i have sent electronic copies
of all of the documents to both tom and laine to finalize once ms . geman
responded .
tom can be reached at : x 55552
laine can be reached at : x 56470

ms . geman ,
i apologize for the delay , but i finally have drafted an escrow agreement for
placing the software in escrow with your attorneys . please review and have
your attorneys review and let me know if it is acceptable .
i will be leaving the department i have been working in and moving to a
different enron subsidiary on october 13 . if at all possible , could we try
to get the software license agreement and the escrow agreement wrapped up
before i leave so that someone else does not have to try to pick up where i
left off ?
i think we are just about in agreement on the software license portion .
seems like the only outstanding question had to do with your concern
regarding providing a response time of 2 business days . i do not have any
answers regarding that - maybe vince kaminski or stinson gibner can respond
on this issue .
i look forward to hearing from you and trying to get this finalized within
the next 2 weeks if possible .
thank you ,

Não tenho certeza de quem ia lidar com este projeto - Tom Moore ou Laine
Borgman Então, por este e -mail, pedirei à pessoa apropriada que responda a
você Eu também dei o nome de Tom e o endereço de e -mail para MS Geman Eles só precisarão mudar no artigo 17 do contrato de licença de software
O tempo de resposta de 2 a 3 dias e a parte da licença de software deve ser
feito A única coisa que iria sair então é a MS Resposta de Geman sobre
o acordo de custódia sobre se era agradável para ela e seu escritório de advocacia
(quem seguraria o código -fonte em garantia) Não tenho certeza se MS Geman respondeu a Tom sobre isso ou não Eu enviei cópias eletrônicas
de todos os documentos para Tom e Laine para finalizar uma vez MS Geman
respondeu Tom pode ser alcançado em: x 55552
Laine pode ser alcançado em: x 56470

Peço desculpas pelo atraso, mas finalmente eu redigi um acordo de garantia para

Acho que estamos quase de acordo com a parte da licença de software Parece que a única excelente pergunta teve a ver com sua preocupação

subscribe to legal except when they've got a particular problem to discuss escapenumber sure but you don't need or want that all you need is an unbiassed sampling of developers to participate which is to say the list needs to be just as open to extremist opinions from people who think the gfdl is completely free as people who think the gpl is actually non free afaics the only way that's going to happen is by taking the view that debian's definition of free as per the dfsg free is just one view you can take and that people who take alternative views whether stricter or more liberal whether focussed on legal details or ignorant of them in favour of just doing stuff are still worth listening to even though their views on what's free or not may well be fundamentally different to debian's if the only question is is this free or not then you're going to get turf wars because there's just no middle ground and whoever gets to make that decision controls the debate even just having analyses take the form of these are the consequences personally i'd avoid them though debian doesn't think the problem's a big enough deal to worry about don agrees with me but francesco doesn't seems like it'd be most of the way there but as it stands legal's analysis seems to me more to fit the mold of this is conceivably bad in some circumstances not the same as anything in any good licenses therefore it's non free and that's all there is to it i'm not sure however that this is the general attitude on legal i've never encountered it escapenumber take don and jordi g h 's exchange this month if you disagree with the determination of the developers you can easily install the work from non free or cease supporting debian in its entirety the choice is yours really escapenumber our way or the highway isn't a nice thought either do you really think that the dds that voted against putting the gfdl in non free should fork off too debian is the best distro out there and i'm very loyal to it but i'malso very unhappy with its treatement of the gfdl and i think this horrible mess should be fixed and no to be fair skimming the archives does indicate it's not the general attitude at all and i'm also pleased to have stumbled across an example of michael poole noting he's not a lawyer or dd while giving his thoughts advice equally if legal were working escapenumber how i wanted it to that'd just mean i'd be happy to trust it implicitly and wouldn't pay any attention to it at all which probably means that the times i do pay attention now are the times it's going imo severely wrong which is going to produce a pretty biassed view on my behalf comparing ted tso's and thomas bushnell's views as cited on lwn some time ago escapenumber is probably a good reference point too having disagreements like the current one over choice of venue be escalated into claims that are one set of dds are trying to prov e they are holier than stallman or another are sell ing out freedom isn't very helpful if we want the dfsg to be useful at helping upstreams and users in my opinion and ymmv etc analysing licenses so that we can say these are almost certainly the effects which barely anyone disagrees with gpl is viral cddl is viral and gpl incompatible qpl requires modifications to be made as patches these are things that might not happen but that you might be concerned at gfdl stuff can't be encrypted or even have unix permission bits set cddl leaves you vulnerable to nuisance suits in foreign countries these are ways you can avoid some of the drawbacks use mit instead of the old bsd license explicitly limit when choice of venue comes into play different people and organisations may reasonably have different views on the acceptability of various effects the fsf view the affero gpl and gfdl as free osi views the apsl as free and you may want to make a different choice to any or all of those organisations debian's choices are focussed on ensuring we can develop and distribute a high quality operating system that works for our users this may mean we'll accept some licenses that aren't as free as we'd like them to be in some cases such as licenses with patch clauses or obnoxious advertising clauses etc escapenumberrom what i've seen debian legal isn't very good at accepting anything less free than it'd like which is pretty understandable but not really helpful either in advocating debian's views which are more accepting or in working with other groups upstream or down who don't have the patience for endless nitpicking it could also be a lot better at summarising thoughts about what will and might happen for a given license we've discussed this years ago read the archives isn't a really good answer obviously if debian's going to say a license isn't free enough we should be able to explain very simply and without needing to be very hypothetical or theoretical how users developers distributors are going to be blocked escapenumberrom doing useful things that is what the bad effects are not just point at the bad clause or your right freedom that's being violated if the cddl is non free we ought to be able to come up with an explanation like if someone creates a new version of opensolaris don't assign their copyright to sun and you download and use it they can and thus prevent you from travelling to anywhere in the united states or canada without having to pay extortionate damages simply by the fact that you've downloaded and used their software that's sufficient to convince reasonable people not just people who've already signed onto the dfsg that they don't want to use non sun copyrighted versions of opensolaris sun versions of opensolaris are different in that aiui we have a sun rep or two on the record as indicating that circumstance isn't intended which should be sufficient to stop it actually happening if we decide our acceptance of the cddl relies on that assurance then we can add it to debian copyright for packages it covers and not distribute ones it doesn't cheers aj escapenumber http lwn net articles escapenumber ,on tue jun escapenumber escapenumber at escapenumber escapenumber escapenumberam

are one set of dds are trying to prov e they are holier than stallman or another are sell ing out freedom isn't very helpful if we want the dfsg to be useful at helping upstreams and users in my opinion and ymmv etc analysing licenses so that we can say these are almost certainly the effects which barely anyone disagrees with gpl is viral cddl is viral and gpl incompatible qpl requires modifications to be made as patches these are things that might not happen but that you might be concerned at gfdl stuff can't be encrypted or even have unix permission bits set cddl leaves you vulnerable to nuisance suits in foreign countries these are ways you can avoid some of the drawbacks use mit instead of the old bsd license explicitly limit when choice of venue comes into play different people and organisations may reasonably have different views on the acceptability of various effects the fsf view the affero gpl and gfdl as free osi views the apsl as free and you may want to make a different choice to any or all of those organisations debian's choices are focussed on ensuring we can develop and distribute a high quality operating system that works for our users this may mean we'll accept some licenses that aren't as free as we'd like them to be in some cases such as licenses with patch clauses or obnoxious advertising clauses etc escapenumberrom what i've seen debian legal isn't very good at accepting anything less free than it'd like which is pretty understandable but not really helpful either in advocating debian's views which are more accepting or in working with other groups upstream or down who don't have the patience for endless nitpicking it could also be a lot better at summarising thoughts about what will and might happen for a given license we've discussed this years ago read the archives isn't a really good answer obviously if debian's going to say a license isn't free enough we should be able to explain very simply and without needing to be very hypothetical or theoretical how users developers distributors are going to be blocked escapenumberrom doing useful things that is what the bad effects are not just point at the bad clause or your right freedom that's being violated if the cddl is non free we ought to be able to come up with an explanation like if someone creates a new version of opensolaris don't assign their copyright to sun and you download and use it they can and thus prevent you from travelling to anywhere in the united states or canada without having to pay extortionate damages simply by the fact that you've downloaded and used their software that's sufficient to convince reasonable people not just people who've already signed onto the dfsg that they don't want to use non sun copyrighted versions of opensolaris sun versions of opensolaris are different in that aiui we have a sun rep or two on the record as indicating that circumstance isn't intended which should be sufficient to stop it actually happening if we decide our acceptance of the cddl relies on that assurance then we can add it to debian copyright for packages it covers and not distribute ones it doesn't cheers aj escapenumber http

subject : merit increases
norma ,
it seems that there is a bug in the system . i made an error mixing equity and
merit raises in one column . the system does not allow me to correct the
mistake by
moving the entries from one column to another . i can enter the changes , but
after i save them the system reverts to original designations .
as a result , the columns contain mixed entries related to merit and equity
raises .
the column totals are misleading .
i am taking a csv version home to continue making adjustments .
i shall work at home monday ( 281 367 5377 ) .

Assunto: Merito aumenta
Norma,
Parece que há um bug no sistema Eu cometi um erro misturando patrimônio e
O mérito aumenta em uma coluna o sistema não me permite corrigir o
erro por
movendo as entradas de uma coluna para outra Eu posso entrar nas mudanças, mas
Depois de salvar, o sistema reverte para as designações originais Como resultado, as colunas contêm entradas mistas relacionadas ao mérito e patrimônio líquido
aumenta Os totais da coluna são enganosos Estou levando uma versão CSV para casa para continuar fazendo ajustes Vou trabalhar em casa na segunda -feira (281 367 5377) Vince"

dirk ellison with eog has contacted me twice this morning about the efm at
the location . he told me they planned to come on tuesday evening . i have told
him both times that we could not proceed until i receive word from you and
earl that all the agreements are in place . he had contacted jerry ball , who
contacted their marketing , and their reply was to tell us ( in the field ) to
proceed . i tried to explain that we needed that go - ahead from our folks , not
theirs . also , an issue came up on the operations conference call this morning
about quality equipment - h 2 s , h 2 o , sampler , gas chromatograph . the team had
told rich it was about a 20 mmcfd point , dirk indicated to me they were
looking at more like 16 mmcfd commercial power is about a mile away from the
location per the operations team and some of this equipment could require
power .
we have got lots going on this week , could someone explain the situation to
eog ?

i suggest we complete the work at the site and have our facilities ready to

we will get with eog to request payment for the efm before we proceed . any

Se descobrirmos alguma despesa, o EOG deve nos reembolsar, mas obter dinheiro
deles é como puxar dentes Eu sugiro que completemos o trabalho no local e tenham nossas instalações prontas para

in assessing the market over the next 3 - 4 years .
with the octane shortage this summer , and the strong gas and oil price
environment , mtbe prices are well above budgeted levels . how will
political / environmental issues affect mtbe prices over the next few years .
methanol prices are also now very favorable , but it would seem that north
american methanol producers will be disadvantaged if gas prices in na remain
higher than the rest of the world .
your thoughts on these and any other factors affecting prices would be most
helpful . both dwight and i are available to meet with you or a member of
your group as soon as convenient .

vince ,
i have inquired into christian ' s climate models . it seems to me like a long
term project . chiristian says that his model might be able to do better than
the australian met given that they ignore some of the variables he uses and
that they are an "" old boy ' s network "" resistant to new developments , but i
don ' t think the same can be said of most other weather services . as far as
the nws goes , they run their model on a cray , they have several very talented
phd ' s working on it full - time , and even then , they can only get a dozen or
so runs per night . in other words , it ' s a huge system . replicating something
even close to that will not be an easy task .
that being said , i think there are related applications that we could look
into . since i ' ve already promised the rac group and the weather desk ' s pjm
traders to put together a vector autoregressive model of daily temperatures ,
i think it makes sense to see if something better than a var model can be put
together , perhaps a very stripped down version of the kind of model christian
has . what i have in mind is something that would give us say , up to several
dozens of "" possible "" temperature forecasts every morning , which would be
calculated using actual climate models ( as opposed to time series models ) . i
would not use this as a forecasting tool ( the nws model results would make a
far better "" best guess "" ) , but our ensemble could still be used to provide a
distribution of temperature scenarios . this ensemble would have several uses :
1 ) we could price the book for the ensemble of runs and thereby obtain a
more realistic daily v @ r for the weather book ( and eventually interface that
with the power desk ' s v @ r calculations )
2 ) we could use the ensemble of forecasts to relate temperature forecasts to
week - ahead cdd and hdd distributions ( for use in our demand swaps )
3 ) if freese - notis were to give us one of their qualitative forecasts ,
e . g . , "" expect the trough to recede "" we could sort through the different monte
carlo scenarions , find one in which the trough in question is receding , and
use corresponding output statistics to download the actual temperatures
corresponding to that scenario . up till now , we haven ' t found a good way of
getting a numerical fix on what different forecasts actually mean
temperature - wise
4 ) we could use the associated visualization routines that come with such
models to get animations of the evolution of historical weather patterns . the
traders could use these in order to look for historical periods which roughly
match current weather conditions and get an idea of what could happen ;
although these meteorological models would not be good for simulating
month - ahead or season - ahead weather ( trust me on this ) we could still use the
visualization technology to do to analogous seasonal animations .
just today , i ' ve spoken with dr . jacobsen of stanford university , who has
written one of the more recent textbooks on climate forecasting , and who
worked with ucla ' s general circulation model . he says that getting a
simplified version of mm 5 ( which is itself a simplified , limited - area version
of the gcm models that nws , cola , and ucla use ) would take several months to
implement , assuming the people involved are already well versed in the
technology . also , i have contacted aer , a massachusetts - based weather
consulting firm , and they tell me that they have a mm 5 model running daily
( only one run per night ) , and also some smaller pc models up and running .
they are of course willing to work with us for a fee . their mm 5 version runs
on a $ 200 , 000 parallel processor .
i am open to your suggestions ( or objections as the case may be ) . i ' m not
sure how the costs would be apportioned given that this would benefit all of
enron , and not just the weather desk .
i am scheduled to go to boston next week anyway , and would like to use the
opportunity to visit with aer . i will of course coordinate any projects with
christian ( if we get something like this up and running it will be more
likely that he can get the computing power he needs to run his own australian
model ) .

assunto :
Vince,
Eu perguntei sobre os modelos climáticos de Christian Parece -me um longo
Projeto de termo Chiristian diz que seu modelo pode ser capaz de fazer melhor do que
o australiano se reuniu, pois eles ignoram algumas das variáveis ​​que ele usa e
que eles são uma ""rede do velho"" resistente a novos desenvolvimentos, mas eu
Não pense que o mesmo pode ser dito sobre a maioria dos outros serviços climáticos tão longe quanto
O NWS vai, eles dirigem seu modelo em uma giz, eles têm vários muito talentosos
O doutorado está trabalhando nele - tempo e mesmo assim, eles só podem obter uma dúzia ou
Então funciona por noite Em outras palavras, é um sistema enorme replicar algo
Mesmo perto disso, não será uma tarefa fácil Dito isto, acho que há aplicativos relacionados que poderíamos olhar
em Desde que eu já prometi o grupo RAC e o PJM da mesa meteorológica
comerciantes para montar um modelo autoregressivo vetorial de temperaturas diárias,
Eu acho que faz sentido ver se algo melhor do que um modelo Var pode ser colocado
Juntos, talvez uma versão muito despojada do tipo de modelo cristão
tem O que tenho em mente é algo que nos daria dizer, até vários
dezenas de previsões de temperatura ""possíveis"" todas as manhãs, o que seria
calculado usando modelos climáticos reais (em oposição aos modelos de séries temporais) eu
não usaria isso como uma ferramenta de previsão (os resultados do modelo NWS faria um
muito melhor ""melhor palpite""), mas nosso conjunto ainda pode ser usado para fornecer um
distribuição de cenários de temperatura Este conjunto teria vários usos:
1) Poderíamos precificar o livro para o conjunto de corridas e, assim, obter um
mais realista diário v @ r para o livro meteorológico (e eventualmente interface que
com os cálculos V @ R do Power Desk)
2) poderíamos usar o conjunto de previsões para relacionar previsões de temperatura a
Semana - Distribuições de CDD e HDD à frente (para uso em nossos swaps de demanda)
3) Se Freese - Notis nos dar uma de suas previsões qualitativas,
e g , ""Espere que a calha recuasse"", poderíamos classificar os diferentes Monte
Cenários de Carlo, encontre um em que a calha em questão está recuando, e
Use estatísticas de saída correspondentes para baixar as temperaturas reais
correspondente a esse cenário Até agora, não encontramos uma boa maneira de
Obtendo uma correção numérica no que diferentes previsões realmente significam
Temperatura - sábia
4) poderíamos usar as rotinas de visualização associadas que vêm com tal
Modelos para obter animações da evolução dos padrões climáticos históricos o
Os comerciantes poderiam usá -los para procurar períodos históricos que aproximadamente
Combine as condições climáticas atuais e tenha uma idéia do que poderia acontecer;
Embora esses modelos meteorológicos não seriam bons para simular
mês - adiante ou estação - clima à frente (confie em mim), ainda poderíamos usar o
Tecnologia de visualização a fazer para análogos análogos análogos Só hoje, falei com o dr Jacobsen, da Universidade de Stanford, que tem
escrito um dos livros mais recentes sobre previsão climática e quem
trabalhou com o modelo de circulação geral da UCLA Ele diz que conseguir um
Versão simplificada do MM 5 (que é uma versão simplificada e limitada da área
dos modelos GCM que NWS, cola e UCLA usam) levaria vários meses para
implementar, assumindo que as pessoas envolvidas já são bem versadas no
tecnologia Além disso, entrei em contato com a AER, um clima baseado em Massachusetts
empresa de consultoria, e eles me dizem que têm um modelo MM 5 em execução diariamente
(apenas uma corrida por noite) e também alguns modelos de PC menores em funcionamento É claro que eles estão dispostos a trabalhar conosco por uma taxa A versão MM 5 é executada
em um processador paralelo de US $ 200.000 Estou aberto às suas sugestões (ou objeções conforme o caso) eu não sou
Claro como os custos seriam distribuídos, uma vez que isso beneficiaria tudo
Enron, e não apenas a mesa meteorológica Estou programado para ir para Boston na próxima semana, e gostaria de usar o
oportunidade de visitar a AER É claro que coordenarei qualquer projeto com
cristão (se conseguirmos algo assim em funcionamento, será mais
provável que ele possa obter o poder de computação que precisa para administrar seu próprio australiano
modelo ) Joe"

nomad of the gross revenue generated by lmb technologies inc . of any sales
and other revenue generated from the license . additional consideration
payable to nomad includes 20 % of the common stock of lmb technologies
inc . which will seek a public listing of its common shares in the u . s

may 18 - nomad international inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent
announcement by the canadian radio - television and telecommunications
commission ( crtc ) that they would regulate voice over internet protocol
( voip ) service only when it is provided and used as local telephone
service .
in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to build
sustainable competition in local telephone markets , the incumbent carriers
will not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to
stifle competition .
the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter
the canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,
cable companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the
market with a competitive framework , stated jan oliver , ceo of nomad
international inc .
the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its
products to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization
worldwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the
u . s . alone , there are over 20 o , ooo , 0 oo users of the internet . of the
total users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is only
approximately 40 , oo 0 , 000 ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore
represents approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market .
the percentage of dial - up versus broadband users worldwide is even
higher .
nomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service
providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration ,
but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace
by offering a unique , proprietary and easily adaptable product .

at the wedding came from neither the u s nor spain but from hungary his name is laszlo szekfu at escapenumber he's one of hungary's best known internet entrepreneurs he's also an adviser to the minister of economy and transport and he's using his networking skills to build a biotechnology cluster around a promising vaccine for hiv aids so why was he at the wedding for the past semester he's been a yale world fellow which means he's been paid to attend high level classes at yale while networking with escapenumber other world fellows as they work to increase global cooperation as well as stimulate progress in their own countries when this young man was born escapenumber years ago hungary was still controlled by communists and the future was bleak today it's a member of the european union still struggling with inflation and unemployment but expecting to adopt the euro by escapenumber if not by escapenumber and entrepreneurs like laszlo szekfu are part of the reason but what does this have to do with investing well at the very least it reminds me that it's a big world out there with a wide range of investment opportunities if you're limiting yourself to american blue chips you're missing out on a lot of the fun more specifically it reminds me that as communism falls by the wayside in various countries around the world younger generations who are not saddled by memories and habits learned in the old days are turning the underused assets of their countries to good use just as laszlo is in hungary holdouts to this trend are north korea and cuba but the clock is ticking and then there's china which nominally is still communist but practically speaking is determinedly capitalistic to me this feels like a new model and i think it's appropriate for a country in transition what comes next for china no one knows ideally a far more educated populace a representative democracy free elections and a higher standard of living though not necessarily in that order but regardless of whether communism eventually withers in china you can't ignore the fact that today china's economy is booming along at a escapenumber rate more or less the reliability of the figures is questionable and authorities are working hard to keep it from expanding faster workers are streaming from their farms into cities where jobs are multiplying rapidly and consumers are beginning to spend which brings me to my first stock mastercard mastercard of course is a well known name it's one of the top two credit card companies in the world but it's no dinosaur it's taking full advantage of the globalization movement to leverage its brand and the results are apparent in the company's first quarter results which revealed a escapenumber increase in transactions over last year a escapenumber increase in revenues and a escapenumber increase in earnings those results touched of a wave of new buying a few weeks ago which earned the stock a place in cabot top ten report and here's what we said mastercard is a global brand and a very profitable one it provides services in more than escapenumber countries serving over escapenumber escapenumber financial institutions yet its business is not well understood by most consumers mastercard does not issue credit cards or set interest rates or annual fees on cards or solicit merchants to use cards but it serves as a liaison between financial institutions and merchants and the businesses and customers that use its cards taking a tiny fee for every payment processed and working hard to keep the system secure it even acts as an advisor to all those parties using its data mining capabilities to tell its partners how they can derive maximum benefit from the service mastercard's is a well established robust business with limited competition and it's only getting better two factors we like in particular in recent quarters revenue growth has been accelerating and in the latest quarter the profit margin hit a plum escapenumber escapenumber the best in years if not ever fundamentally we also like the stock because it's only been public for one year so there are far more potential buyers especially among institutions than sellers looking deeper into the business i see that mastercard has been offering services in china since escapenumber and that its greatest growth in the first quarter came from china india and brazil looking forward i expect more of the same so i recommend the stock as a long term holding advertisement our next escapenumber stocks could put you on easy street cabot top ten report comes to your email inbox once a week with capsule analyses of the market's ten strongest stocks some are big some are small some are young and some are old our job is to describe why each one is strong to give you an idea of how likely that strength is to continue and to provide a follow up in each issue until we tell you to sell it's the single best way we know to find great growth stocks in their early stages stocks like hansen natural titanium metals and ultra petroleum to get started with a no risk trial subscription simply click the link below http cabotmail net t escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber now some of you are going to look at this stock and say mastercard is trading for escapenumber a share i can't afford that give me something that's under escapenumber and i understand where you're coming from you think you have a better chance of making money in a stock that's selling for under escapenumber than you do of making money in a stock that's selling for escapenumber but with all due respect you're wrong sure the low priced stock has the potential to make you money faster but it also has the potential to take your money away faster more importantly it is more likely to take your money away at bottom it's a matter of quality the escapenumber stock which is in an uptrend is supported by a growing number of institutions and by improving perceptions not to mention excellent fundamentals but most stocks selling under escapenumber got there by falling from above escapenumber and that alone tells you something went wrong furthermore it suggests there are shareholders still waiting to sell until the stock climbs back to their buy price so they get out even and it tells you there will precious few institutional shareholders to provide stability for the stock consider for example three names from our past going back as far as ten years when we and many other investors thought hydrogen fuel cells were the next big thing there was ballard power bldp which had partnered with daimler and ford to provide fuel cells for cars and there were fuel cell energy fcel and plug power plug who were working on fuel cells for stationary applications have you seen any fuel cell powered cars lately no you see toyota priuses and houses powered by hydrogen it's not happening in every case the hopes and dreams of both management and investors have failed to come true as a result all three stocks are trading in the single digits bldp is escapenumber fcel is escapenumber and plug is escapenumber and commissions in the old days it may have mattered but in the internet era it doesn't you can spend escapenumber buying one share of mastercard assuming a escapenumber commission or you can spend it buying escapenumber shares of plug power i think your chances are better with one share of mastercard the symbol is ma and now that we're on energy i can segue into a hot little energy stock with great growth potential the background china gets escapenumber of its energy from coal it burns escapenumber escapenumber billion tons of coal per year more than the u s e u and japan combined and this coal pollutes its air which causes health problems so there's a great demand for clean energy solutions in china and globally there's growing demand due to increased perceptions of global warming for energy sources that replace the burning of fossil fuels i've mentioned solar power companies before and will likely mention them again i think this is a big growth market and i like the rapid growth these companies are experiencing today so today's topic is trina solar which stands out from the crowd because it's the one company in the industry that's vertically integrated here's what paul goodwin editor of cabot china emerging markets report wrote last month trina is working toward reducing the cost of solar cells in a number of innovative ways first trina's proprietary formulas allow it to use scrap silicon that has been discarded by other electronics and solar manufacturers back in escapenumber when the solar industry used just escapenumber of the world's silicon this wasn't so important but solar has now surpassed semiconductors as a silicon consumer and the global shortage of polysilicon feedstock has put pressure on all users since it takes escapenumber to escapenumber months to get a polysilicon plant up and running trina's ability to use scrap is a major advantage trina's second big advantage it's on the verge of becoming a totally vertically integrated manufacturer meaning that the company will soon refine its own silicon feedstock grow its own ingots cut its own wafers manufacture its own cells assemble its own modules and install its own systems all at its fab site in changzhou trina's third advantage is a little paradoxical it's that trina is both a young company but also already a major player in the industry with long term technology partnerships with companies in switzerland italy and germany trina's ingot production facility became fully operational just in october escapenumber and wafer manufacturing began just in february escapenumber by the end of escapenumber the company had reached escapenumber megawatts mw of production output output capacity is projected to reach escapenumbermw by the end of escapenumber yet despite this relative youth trina has sales in germany spain italy norway and australia in addition to its leadership in sales and research into solar homes and industrial installations in china there is no doubt that the generous subsidies offered by the german government have had a huge effect on global solar production but additional programs in california and renewed global interest in pv electricity production are creating a wave of new customers trina's revenues grew escapenumber in the first quarter to escapenumber escapenumber million while earnings grew escapenumber to escapenumber escapenumber per share and i'm confident there's plenty more growth ahead finally here's the timely part tsl peaked at escapenumber in mid april and then like all solar stocks pulled back toward its escapenumber day moving average in short the solar stocks needed a rest from the heated environment that followed their market leading first quarter performance as i write tsl sits right on that escapenumber day moving average at escapenumber and i think this marks a decent buying opportunity editor's note to get the latest recommendation on trina solar and other exciting emerging market stocks try a no risk subscription to cabot china emerging

at the wedding invest in this credit card company for long term profits my favorite chinese solar power stock last weekend i attended a wedding here in salem the daughter of a friend married a young man from madrid and i was fortunate to meet a number of interesting young people chiefly recent graduates of johns hopkins and yale as well as a contingent from spain with the spaniards i didn't get beyond the usual wedding pleasantries no surprise given the language barrier on both sides with the young american graduates i did better most interesting were a couple of earnest young men trained in finance one landed a job with morgan stanley in london while the other is working at thomas h lee partners in boston bright young men without question and well trained in finding things to buy that will be worth more later but i got the sense that while both will succeed at their jobs at making money they have no purpose beyond that shades of the thoughts of kevin phillips found in my wealth advisory of may escapenumber with luck greater purpose will come with maturity by far the most interesting guest at the wedding came from neither the u s nor spain but from hungary his name is laszlo

if i may , i ' d like to visit enron again , sometime in august ,
to define the research agenda more precisely and prioritize
the problems to look at . i ' m in frequent contact with giuseppe ,
who is impressed by the environment there . we are trying to formulate
the research issues and problems to study , that would be of interest
to enron . the plan is this :
1 ) by august , giuseppe will have been there for almost 2 months
and will probably have a relatively good understanding of the enron problem
space .
2 ) i will work together with giuseppe till august to formulate a set of
good problems of :
a ) high practical importance
b ) high innovation potential
c ) serious scope .
3 ) i could visit in august ( say mid - august or so ) to :
a ) discuss these problems with you and get your feedback
b ) prioritize the problems and evaluate their impact

Para definir a agenda de pesquisa com mais precisão e priorizar
os problemas para olhar Estou em contato frequente com Giuseppe,
quem está impressionado com o meio ambiente lá Estamos tentando formular
as questões e problemas de pesquisa para estudar, isso seria de interesse
para Enron O plano é o seguinte:
1) Até agosto, Giuseppe estará lá por quase 2 meses
e provavelmente terá um entendimento relativamente bom do problema da Enron
espaço 2) Vou trabalhar em conjunto com Giuseppe até agosto para formular um conjunto de
bons problemas de:
a) alta importância prática
b) alto potencial de inovação

a) Discuta esses problemas com você e obtenha seu feedback
b) priorize os problemas e avalie seu impacto
c) Certifique -se de estar na mesma página sobre estratégia de pesquisa
e caminho de execução Espero que possamos configurar completamente o programa em Stanford antes disso, então
que posso trazer a bordo mais um pH d aluno para começar seu

0,"budget update / suggestions :
piper , richter , and webb met with whalley this saturday for a few hours on overall enrononline strategy and budget . we showed him the development completed to date and the general development list going forward . we also showed him the down time report as well as some growth numbers over the last 12 months . we also explained a few of the commercial objectives going forward . finally , we showed him the same suggested eol budget plan we showed you , including 2001 plan vs . 2001 forecast vs . 2002 plan as well as the allocation methodology . greg is generally ok with the total 2002 plan number for eol ( $ 37 . 7 million fully loaded with bonus , indirects and depreciation ) , why we want that money and where it would be spent . what he did not like was the allocation methodology , which is currently cost based and based on development and products . he suggested a charge that included a fixed fee plus a product setup fee plus a product maintenance fee plus a per transaction charge , etc . richter and webb are researching that and will try to see if it will work . i think you and i can agree the $ 37 . 7 million is good for 2002 but we still need to agree on your part for ea . the current cost based suggestion for ea for eol for 2002 is about $ 22 million . a question is , will you and lavo accept any charges for 2002 for eol based on transactions ? sheriff also has the entire eol suggested budget and his part . we meet eim and egm today on their total enw charges .
on operations , the current suggested 2002 ea charge is $ 44 . 7 million , which is also a fully loaded number and is slightly down from 2001 forecast ( sally and bob and i can explain that in detail this week ) . what i would like to do is agree between you and i that you will accept that as eas budget number for 2002 plan for operations . what we still need to work on is how we would possibly bill that in some fixed and variable form that includes transaction counts .
on infrastructure , the current suggested ea plan number for 2002 $ 40 . 9 million . this is down from 2001 forecast . this does not include the $ 10 . 5 million of controllable expense you budget directly for ea . the issue left here is what is eas headcount , what is the headcount in it development and what is the server infrastructure charge related to it development that would effect the ea number . on the first issue , we have the ea headcount as represented by hr . the current ea infrastructure charge assumes that complete number . it is larger than the number you have . you have requested we deal with some of that additional headcount differently since ea can ' t bill out those on a fully loaded basis . we will work with wes and his team on that today and tomorrow to come up with a plan .
on it development , the current suggested 2002 plan expense number for ea , fully loaded , is $ $ 44 . 5 million vs . a 2001 forecast of $ 34 . 4 million . also , the 2002 suggested capital number for ea is $ 50 . 1 million vs . a 2001 forecast capital number of $ 50 million . the question is , what did you get for your $ 84 . 4 million in 2001 and what would you get for $ 94 . 6 million in 2002 ? first , mark and sally and i met on sunday and we want the 2002 plan numbers to be down from 2001 forecast . what we need to do in the next three days is finalize what are the critical maintenance and new development projects for 2002 for ea . our team is bob hall , mark pickering ( mark will call on stock and perlman and rao and hotte as he sees necessary ) and greg piper with pickering having the final say for enw . can you tell me who you want from your side ( story ? belden ? ) to work with us three over the next few days until we agree ? we want to work on it around the clock until it is at least approximately right .
your thoughts ?

_ _ _ _ _","Atualização / sugestões de orçamento:
Piper, Richter e Webb se encontraram com Whalley neste sábado por algumas horas na estratégia e orçamento geral da Enrononline Mostramos a ele o desenvolvimento concluído até o momento e a lista de desenvolvimento geral daqui para frente Também mostramos a ele o relatório de tempo de inatividade, bem como alguns números de crescimento nos últimos 12 meses Também explicamos alguns dos objetivos comerciais daqui para frente Finalmente, mostramos a ele o mesmo plano de orçamento da EOL sugerido que mostramos, incluindo o plano de 2001 vs 2001 Previsão vs. Plano de 2002, bem como a metodologia de alocação Greg geralmente é bom com o número total de planos de 2002 para a EOL (US $ 37 7 milhões totalmente carregados de bônus, indiretos e depreciação), por que queremos esse dinheiro e onde seria gasto O que ele não gostou foi a metodologia de alocação, que atualmente é baseada em custos e baseada em desenvolvimento e produtos Ele sugeriu uma cobrança que incluía uma taxa fixa mais uma taxa de configuração do produto mais uma taxa de manutenção do produto mais uma taxa por transação, etc. Richter e Webb estão pesquisando isso e tentarão ver se vai funcionar Eu acho que você e eu posso concordar com os $ 37 7 milhões são bons para 2002, mas ainda precisamos concordar com sua parte para EA A sugestão atual baseada em custos para a EOL para 2002 é de cerca de US $ 22 milhões Uma pergunta é: você e Lavo aceitarão alguma cobrança para 2002 para a EOL com base em transações? O xerife também tem todo o orçamento sugerido pela EOL e sua parte Nós encontramos EIM e EGM hoje em suas cobranças totais de ENW Em operações, o atual Charge da EA de 2002 é de US $ 44 7 milhões, que também é um número totalmente carregado e está ligeiramente abaixo da previsão de 2001 (Sally e Bob e eu podemos explicar isso em detalhes nesta semana) O que eu gostaria de fazer é concordar entre você e eu que você aceitará isso como o número do orçamento da EAS para o plano de 2002 para operações O que ainda precisamos trabalhar é como possivelmente cobraríamos que, em algum formulário fixo e variável, que inclua contagens de transações Na infraestrutura, o número do plano atual sugerido por 2002 $ 40 9 milhões Isso está abaixo da previsão de 2001 Isso não inclui os $ 10 5 milhões de despesas controláveis ​​que você orçou diretamente para EA A questão deixada aqui é o que é o número de funcionários da EAS, qual é o número de funcionários do desenvolvimento de TI e qual é a cobrança de infraestrutura do servidor relacionada ao desenvolvimento de TI que afetaria o número da EA Na primeira edição, temos o número de funcionários da EA, como representado por RH A atual cobrança de infraestrutura da EA assume que o número completo é maior que o número que você tem Você solicitou que lidamos com parte desse número de funcionários adicionais de maneira diferente, já que a EA não pode cobrar daqueles que estão totalmente carregados Trabalharemos com Wes e sua equipe sobre isso hoje e amanhã para criar um plano No desenvolvimento de TI, o número de despesas do plano atual de 2002 sugerido para EA, totalmente carregado, é de US $ 44 5 milhões vs. uma previsão de 2001 de US $ 34 4 milhões Além disso, o número de capital sugerido em 2002 para a EA é $ 50 1 milhão vs. um número de capital previsto de 2001 de US $ 50 milhões A questão é: o que você recebeu por seus $ 84 4 milhões em 2001 e o que você receberia por US $ 94 6 milhões em 2002? Primeiro, Mark e Sally e eu nos conhecemos no domingo e queremos O que precisamos fazer nos próximos três dias é finalizar quais são a manutenção crítica e novos projetos de desenvolvimento para 2002 para a EA Nossa equipe é Bob Hall, Mark Pickering (Mark chamará de estoque e Perlman e Rao e Hotte, como ele considerar necessário) e Greg Piper com Pickering tendo a palavra final para ENW Você pode me dizer quem você quer do seu lado (história? Belden?) Para trabalhar conosco três nos próximos dias até concordarmos? Queremos trabalhar nele o tempo todo até que seja pelo menos aproximadamente certo seus pensamentos?

our convention is whoever finalizes the model should write the documentation . it does not make sense
to write one when changes are anticipated . you have been working on this almost a year , it never

month of june ? ""","Durante o mês de junho, há fluxo no medidor 6347, mas não há acordo Há um acordo em maio (Deal 290472): ""Você poderia estender esse acordo para o
mês de junho? """
0,"executive summary :
? legislators in both parties are scared about a fiscal meltdown and looking for a realistic plan b
? the keeley plan is the most likely vehicle and would include the 30 % generator haircuts and revenue bonds backed by a dedicated rate component
? despite uncertainty over dealing with transmission lines and continued oppostion from burton and his consumer group allies , the keeley plan will probably pass the legislature
? the generators will not support the plan until they get clearer guarantees from the state that investigations and lawsuits will end
? pg it will likely take one to two weeks ( more likely closer to two ) to move a deal through the assembly and the senate and to the governor ' s desk once it is introduced .
2 . what would the new plan b look like ?
- this modified plan b deal , which will originate in the assembly , will almost certainly include a dedicated rate component to pay socal ' s undercollect . revenue bonds will be issued securitized by this dedicated rate component . it is also very likely that the generators would be offered 70 cents on the dollar for what they are owed immediately , with the possibility of more if they win litigation . ( sources report that the state is "" fairly confident "" that at least most generators would not be successful in winning this additional money . ) assembly speaker keeley reportedly remains the driving force behind this plan , and it is being drawn up from within his office .
3 . transmission lines
- it remains unclear at this time whether a transmission line purchase or option to purchase will be put into the deal , since this is a major point of contention between the democrats and republicans . according to sources , the assembly is "" working on this . ""
4 . plan looks good to pass both assembly and senate
- according to sources , the vote count for passing a deal containing the above components ( except the transmission line purchase , which is not yet settled ) "" looks very good . "" the vote in the senate would be "" very close . "" senator burton still opposes a bail - out deal , but he reportedly might not stand in the way of others from voting for the plan , making its passage more likely . even opponents of the plan ( including burton and the consumer advocates ) say that the odds of a modified plan b passing the senate are better than 50 - 50 . these opponents are reportedly "" pessimistic "" about their chances of stopping a plan b from passing at this point .
5 . caveat : generators are waiting for guarantees that the witch hunt will end
- as reported previously , sources continue to believe that generators would be reluctant to take a 70 cent - on - the - dollar haircut without the state offering them relief from further prosecution . ( without this relief , the state could give them 70 cents , then try to take away even more . ) sources report that even opponents of the plan accept that the generators should be offered this relief from prosecution . thus , it appears likely at this time that most generators would accept a 30 percent haircut if they were paid immediately . also , sources believe that the securitization on the dedicated rate component offered in the modified plan b would be sufficient to pay back those generators who successfully litigated to win more than 70 cents on the dollar .
- sources believe that socal edison ' s creditors are likely to forebear from filing an involuntary bankruptcy long enough for this plan to go through , since it would pay back most of what they are owed .
6 . pg & e could also be dealt in
- if this plan succeeds , it will almost certainly be taken to the bankruptcy court and offered to pg & e as part of a reorganization plan . this plan can be offered at any time within pg & e ' s "" period of exclusivity . "" this is a 90 - day period ( though it is often extended ) following the filing of a bankruptcy petition .
- however , sources report that the state is concerned about how to approach the bankruptcy court . based on supreme court precedent ( which legal sources within the state have been reviewing ) , the state would likely lose its sovereign immunity if it entered as a party into the bankrutpcy court . this is a problem because the stakes in this case are so high .
7 . bailout bill would require follow legislation for a new rate structure
- even if the state passes and signs a socal bailout , it would still need to pass a rate structure that would allow socal and pg & e to flow through cost increases to prevent them from once again facing bankrtupcy . therefore , this plan does not make the crisis go away .","sumário executivo :
? Os legisladores de ambos os partidos têm medo de um colapso fiscal e procurar um plano realista B
? O plano de Keeley é o veículo mais provável e incluiria os 30 % de cabelo gerador e os títulos de receita apoiados por um componente de taxa dedicada
? Apesar da incerteza sobre lidar com as linhas de transmissão e a oposição contínua de Burton e seus aliados do grupo de consumidores, o Plano Keeley provavelmente passará pelo Legislativo
? Os geradores não apoiarão o plano até que obtenham garantias mais claras do estado de que investigações e ações judiciais terminarão
? PG provavelmente levará de uma a duas semanas (provavelmente mais perto de dois) para mover um acordo através da Assembléia e do Senado e para a mesa do governador depois de introduzido 2 Como seria o novo Plano B?
- Este acordo do Plano B modificado, que se originará na Assembléia, quase certamente incluirá um componente de taxa dedicado para pagar o sequestro da SoCal Os títulos de receita serão emitidos securitizados por este componente de taxa dedicada Também é muito provável que os geradores recebam 70 centavos por dólar pelo que são devidos imediatamente, com a possibilidade de mais se ganharem litígios (Fontes relatam que o estado está ""bastante confiante"" de que pelo menos a maioria dos geradores não teria sucesso em ganhar esse dinheiro adicional ) O orador da Assembléia Keeley continua sendo a força motriz por trás desse plano, e está sendo elaborada de dentro de seu escritório 3 linhas de transmissão
- Ainda não está claro se uma compra de linha de transmissão ou opção de compra será colocada no negócio, já que esse é um importante ponto de discórdia entre os democratas e os republicanos Segundo fontes, a assembléia está ""trabalhando nisso ""
4 O plano parece bom para passar como assembléia e Senado
- De acordo com fontes, a contagem de votos para a aprovação de um acordo que contém os componentes acima (exceto a compra da linha de transmissão, que ainda não está resolvida) ""parece muito bom ""A votação no Senado seria"" muito próxima ""O senador Burton ainda se opõe a um acordo de fiança, mas ele pode não impedir que outros votem no plano, tornando sua passagem mais provável Até os oponentes do plano (incluindo Burton e os defensores do consumidor) dizem que as chances de um plano modificado B que passam no Senado são melhores que 50 - 50 Esses oponentes são ""pessimistas"" sobre suas chances de impedir um plano B de passar neste momento 5 Advertência: os geradores estão aguardando garantias de que a caça às bruxas acabará
- Como relatado anteriormente, as fontes continuam acreditando que os geradores relutariam em fazer um corte de cabelo de 70 centavos - o corte de cabelo - sem que o estado lhes seja alívio de mais processos (Sem esse alívio, o estado poderia dar a eles 70 centavos e tentar tirar ainda mais ) Fontes relatam que mesmo os oponentes do plano aceitam que os geradores devem receber esse alívio da acusação Assim, parece provável que, neste momento Além disso, as fontes acreditam que a securitização no componente de taxa dedicada oferecida no Plano M modificado seria suficiente para pagar os geradores que litigaram com sucesso para ganhar mais de 70 centavos no dólar - As fontes acreditam que os credores da SoCal Edison provavelmente irão propensar à apresentação de uma falência involuntária por tempo suficiente para que esse plano passasse, uma vez que pagaria a maior parte do que são devidos 6 PG&E também pode ser tratado
- Se esse plano for bem -sucedido, quase certamente será levado ao Tribunal de Falências e oferecido à PG&E como parte de um plano de reorganização Este plano pode ser oferecido a qualquer momento no período de exclusividade da PG&E "" ""Este é um período de 90 dias (embora seja frequentemente estendido) após a apresentação de uma petição de falência - No entanto, as fontes relatam que o estado está preocupado com como abordar o tribunal de falências Com base no precedente da Suprema Corte (que as fontes legais dentro do estado estão revisando), o Estado provavelmente perderia sua imunidade soberana se entrasse como parte no Tribunal de Bancário Isso é um problema porque as apostas neste caso são tão altas 7 A lei de resgate exigiria seguir a legislação para uma nova estrutura de taxa
- Mesmo que o estado passe e assina um resgate do SoCal, ele ainda precisaria passar uma estrutura de taxas que permitiria que o SoCal e a PG&E fluam através dos aumentos de custos para impedir que eles voltem a enfrentar o Bankrtupcy Portanto, este plano não faz a crise desaparecer "

Escola de Negócios Acabei de terminar meu doutorado no salto de preço da eletricidade
difusões: um estudo teórico e empírico em mercados incompletos -
Daí meu interesse na modelagem de preços de eletricidade e preços derivados eu
estava procurando se apossar de uma cópia do seu artigo de 1997, que recentemente
Venha à minha atenção:
""O desafio de preços e riscos - gerenciando derivados de eletricidade"", os EUA
Mercado de energia, Risk Publications, pp 149 - 171 e Les sugeriu que eu entre em contato diretamente com você (Les está viajando atualmente
e não tem uma cópia eletrônica disponível) para solicitar uma cópia e - Aliás, sou professor de matemática financeira / financeira na universidade
de Limerick (Irlanda) e demorou um ano para trabalhar para Caminus UK,
onde estou trabalhando para introduzir e desenvolver uma abordagem baseada em mercados
(Spark - spread) para avaliações reais de ativos na indústria de energia do Reino Unido Obrigado em Advancve

0,"most of you are aware that unify experienced some major performance issues as
we tried to close out the month of july . not to go into any details but
there seemed to be a lot of smaller issues which when combined caused the
issues we saw on monday and to a lesser degree on tuesday . almost all of the
issues relate to the quirkiness of the current version of sybase which is
used for unify ' s database . jeff johnson and his team are putting together a
plan that will address most of these issues and hopefully result in
acceptable performance as we go through next bidweek and try to close for
august . the short term tactical plans include the following :
enhancing certain programs which seem to have become resource hogs as the
amount of data grows .
test and hopefully migrate to the latest version of sybase which will address
some of the issues . this may also require some hardware changes as to where
we store certain data . we will also need some user help in stress testing
prior to moving to production .
addressing with the users billing transactions that have never been finaled .
i have been told that we still have transactions going back to jan of 99 that
have not been finaled or closed out . this puts quite a load on the pma and
accrual process since it has to go back to those open transactions to see
what if any action should be taken with these transactions .
once these changes have been implemented and hopefully bought us a little
time to absorb the tremendous growth we ' ve been seeing via eol then we will
focus on delivering more intermediate and longer term solutions . these
include the following :
rewriting most of the code and moving to a 3 tier environment which will be
much more scalable .
moving off of sybase and on to microsoft sql server or oracle . it will be
easier to move microsoft sql server but we have to be sure it is the right
solution in the long term .
jeff will be following up with some of you to go over a much more detailed
plan . needless to say that this is his groups highest priority and his best
people are working on these efforts . this will slow down major enhancement
efforts such as enhancing the gas applications to handle hourly trades and
nominations . we will keep you informed as we start to roll out the tactical
solutions . in the mean time feel free to contact me at x - 36858 or jeff at
x - 39694 if you have any questions or require additional detail . thanks ! -

Antes de se mudar para a produção abordando com as transações de cobrança de usuários que nunca foram finalizadas Foi -me dito que ainda temos transações voltando a Jan de 99 que
não foram finalizados ou fechados Isso coloca uma carga bastante no PMA e
processo de acumulação, pois tem que voltar a essas transações abertas para ver
E se alguma ação deve ser tomada com essas transações Uma vez que essas mudanças foram implementadas e esperançosamente nos compraram um pouco
Hora de absorver o tremendo crescimento que vemos via EOL, então vamos
Concentre -se em fornecer soluções mais intermediárias e de longo prazo esses
Inclua o seguinte:
reescrever a maior parte do código e mudar para um ambiente de 3 camadas que será

easier to move microsoft sql server but we have to be sure it is the right
solution in the long term jeff will be following up with some of you to go over a much more detailed
plano Escusado será dizer que esta é a maior prioridade de seus grupos e seu melhor
As pessoas estão trabalhando nesses esforços Isso vai desacelerar um grande aumento
esforços como melhorar as aplicações de gás para lidar com negociações por hora e
indicações Vamos mantê -lo informado quando começamos a lançar a tática
soluções Nesse meio tempo, sinta -se à vontade para entrar em contato comigo em X - 36858 ou Jeff em

0,thanks very much for the explanation below al original message from spie sutherland to speakup is a screen review system for linux sent wednesday june escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber pm subject re speakup in userspace consider the linux that most of use to be a protected mode operating system as opposed to real mode protected mode allows access to things like virtual memory multi threading and priviledge levels not available in real mode protected mode has been the standard on xescapenumber pcs since the escapenumber a protected mode system segregates virtual memory into kernel space and user space kernel space is strictly reserved for running the kernel device drivers and kernel extensions it is usually the case that kernel space memory is not swapped to disk since that is much slower which user space memory can be swapped to disk user space or userland processes cannot access the memory of other processes the basis of memory protection which makes linux very stable prior to winescapenumberk the windows os was not a protected memory system hence the freezing up or crashing of whole system from one bug in one driver or app a user space process although restricted in memory access can request the kernel to map part of its memory onto its own space and can also access shared memory the kernel space is the direct hardware access space along with the management software that controls virtual memory dma threads processes etc you have kernel processes and user processes the kernel processes are supposed to be basic things like the direct interface to hardware user space is where applications run so there is kernel space memory threads and processes and user space memory threads and processes consider alsa sound as an example it's in the kernel but it's also not in the kernel there are kernel drivers and there are user space libraries the alsa lib delegates sound control to user space this allows application developers to do all kinds of things without touching kernel code the alsa lib provides various functionality like software mixing support for the older oss api and user specific configuration and it is multi thread safe essential for complex audio programs alsa may not be the best example but the idea is separating the core functionality from the application layer let's say i create an api for writing text to a speech synth the code that actually talks to the synth would ideally be abstracted from the api such that the identical programming interface works for any synth using any protocol like serial or usb some hardware may not implement all parts of the api but where there are same functions the api should look the same an example of a very well abstracted api is the java api it had to be done that way in order to make the programs portable on different systems i may be biased because i used to work there but if you look at how much work was done on abstraction it's the most impressively abstracted api around i'm not talking about javascript that's like a virus hehe unfortunately sun wanted java to be the answer to everything everywhere which it is not and will never be and java like many good ideas has become overly bloated and complex although at least the various parts of it are separate apis and the compact versions like jescapenumberme are still very efficient they run on almost all phones now there is a good reason for this i wrote some apps on blackberry and it was a breeze to do so compared with doing it in c or asm it's an entirely different world spie speakup mailing list

we have decided to go ahead with the purchase of a single license of imsl
libraries ( c / c + + ) for pc . i believe that would be cnl 4 . 0 forpc . let me
check the cost for the license before we finalize it as i have mislaid your
previous e - mail about the cost . it is my recollection that it is less than
$ 1500 . please e - mail to confirm with the precise number so we can proceed
wih that .

rakesh ,
as we discussed , the cnl 4 . 0 pc libraries are not license managed . version
5 will be . the pc version 4 . 0 can be installed on a network drive and
called from networked pcs . as expected , we would ask that enron honor the
license agreement by allowing only the number of simultaneous uses
permitted
by the license . version 5 . 0 will be license managed and can be licensed as
node locked or floating .
with regard to unix licensing , the current version of cnl for unix is
license managed . it can be licensed as node locked or floating . if you
install the libraries on a unix server as node locked , the number of
simultaneous sessions on that server is not limited except by the
capabilities of the machine . a floating unix license would be checked out
by the individual user to be executed on a local machine .
also as mentioned , your investment is protected by allowing you to upgrade
in the future by paying only the price difference between your current and
desired platforms . this upgrade option only applies to licenses covered
under support .
if you have any additional questions , please let me know . i look forward
to
providing you the best math and statistical libraries available today to
help you solve your problems and understand your data .

Como discutimos, o CNL 4 0 bibliotecas de PC não são gerenciadas por licença versão
5 será A versão PC 4 0 pode ser instalado em uma unidade de rede e
chamado de PCs em rede Como esperado, pediríamos que a Enron honre o
Contrato de licença, permitindo apenas o número de usos simultâneos
permitido
pela licença Versão 5 0 será gerenciado com licença e pode ser licenciado como
nó bloqueado ou flutuante No que diz respeito ao licenciamento da UNIX, a versão atual da CNL para o Unix é
Licença gerenciada pode ser licenciado como nó bloqueado ou flutuante se você
Instale as bibliotecas em um servidor Unix como o nó bloqueado, o número de
sessões simultâneas nesse servidor não são limitadas, exceto pelo
recursos da máquina Uma licença UNIX flutuante seria verificada
pelo usuário individual a ser executado em uma máquina local Além disso, como mencionado, seu investimento está protegido, permitindo que você atualize
no futuro, pagando apenas a diferença de preço entre o seu atual e
Plataformas desejadas Esta opção de atualização se aplica apenas às licenças cobertas
sob apoio Se você tiver alguma dúvida adicional, por favor me avise Estou ansioso

cera knowledge areas : refined products
us margin highlights
* responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels ,
us gulf coast unleaded gasoline margins versus wti fell by $ 2 . 26 per barrel
to average $ 1 . 45 per barrel during november . gasoline margins have returned
to a historically normal range after spending the summer of 2000 at
exceptionally high values . cera expects gasoline margins to wti to average
$ 2 . 75 per barrel during the first quarter of the new year , $ 1 . 16 per barrel
lower than this year ' s first quarter average .
* high sulfur no . 2 fuel oil differentials with wti dropped slightly ,
averaging $ 5 . 97 per barrel in november . despite the drop of $ 0 . 37 per barrel
from october ' s average , fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented
values - $ 4 . 20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $ 3 . 46 per barrel greater
that the previous five - year average . for the first quarter of 2001 , cera
anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record
high level of $ 4 . 75 per barrel in the first quarter .
* jet / kerosene differentials versus wti rose $ 0 . 63 per barrel from the
october average , reaching a whopping $ 8 . 59 per barrel in november . in
correspondence with the distillate market , jet / kerosene margins are at
historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight
fundamentals . cera expects jet / kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the
first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the
holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of
$ 5 . 75 per barrel .
* margins for us gulf coast 1 % sulfur residual fuel dropped by $ 2 . 15 per
barrel , reaching $ 3 . 99 per barrel below wti during november . despite the
recent widening of differentials , cera expects soaring natural gas prices to
support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter
months . residual fuel differentials are expected to average $ 2 . 50 per barrel
below wti during the first quarter of next year , at the high end of the
historical range .
us demand highlights
* apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0 . 5 million
barrels per day ( mbd ) from the october level , reaching 8 . 36 mbd for the four
weeks ending december 8 . demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last
year largely because y 2 k concerns helped inflate december demand a year ago .
cera anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder
temperatures arrive , averaging 8 . 08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001 .
* reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3 . 94
mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 , over 7 percent greater than this
time last year . this represents a slight increase of about 0 . 05 million
barrels ( mb ) from the end - october level of 3 . 90 mb , but still a record high
level for early december . with support from low home heating oil inventories ,
particularly in the northeast , distillate demand has been very strong during
the fall of 2000 . cera expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter
months , averaging 3 . 79 mb during the first quarter of next year .
* apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the october level
to reach 1 . 68 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 . despite the decline ,
apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year - ago level . the
relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel
distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to
help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals . cera expects the
demand for jet fuel to average 1 . 81 mb during the fourth quarter .
* reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0 . 87 mbd for the four weeks
ending december 8 , a decline of about 0 . 09 mbd from the october average and a
slight increase over the november level . demand for residual fuel is
currently 11 percent greater than last year , and surging natural gas prices
are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout
the winter . residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0 . 85 to 0 . 9 mbd
range during the first quarter of 2001 .
us inventory highlights
* primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196 . 5 mb , increasing
almost 10 mb from the end - october value . responding to rising stock levels
and declining apparent demand , forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to
23 . 5 days for the four weeks ending december 8 . forward supply is 2 . 5 percent
below last year ' s level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the
past eight years - although cera still believes coverage is currently
sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter . however , cera is
looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and
production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the
start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year .
* distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of
october at 29 . 2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 .
despite record high apparent demand , strong refinery production levels helped
boost primary distillate inventories slightly , to 115 . 3 mb for this period .
primary stocks are 16 percent below last year ' s level at this time and at
their lowest historical level ever . although stocks are low , cera does not
anticipate shortages to occur this winter . assuming normally cold weather ,
refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting
demand requirements - albeit at a high price .
* jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage , to
reach 25 . 7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 . this
moves jet fuel coverage above the 23 . 5 to 25 days ' supply range that it had
been in for the past four months . the rise of just under 1 day in forward
supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand . jet inventories
and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull
from tight distillate markets strengthen , but supplies are expected to be
adequate for the winter .
* inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply
from october , reaching 41 . 7 days of forward supply during the four weeks
ending december 8 . the increase in coverage was a temporary response to a
drop in demand and an increase in stocks . with demand expected to strengthen
because of colder weather and high gas prices , cera looks for inventories and
coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks .

escapenumber gmt from nathaniel grey however what i really want to know is how well my nueral net is doing at classifying my binary output variable i am new to r and i can't figure out how you can assess the success rates of predictions i've been recently tacking this myself though with respect to polytomous escapenumber outcomes the following approaches are based on menard escapenumber cohen et al escapenumber and manning schütze escapenumber first you have to decide what is the critical probability that you use to classify the cases into class a and consequently not class a the simplest level is escapenumber escapenumber but other levels might also be motivated see e g cohen et al escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber you can then treat the classification task as two distinct types namely classification and prediction models which have an effect on how the efficiency and accuracy of prediction is exactly measured menard escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber in a pure prediction model we set no a priori expectation or constraint on the overall frequencies of the predicted classes to the contrary in a classification model our expectation is that the predicted outcome classes on the long run will end up having the same proportions as are evident in the training data as the starting point for evaluating prediction efficiency is to compile a escapelong prediction classification table frequency counts on the decending diagonal in the table indicate correctly predicted and classified cases whereas all counts off the diagonal are incorrect for the two alternatives overerall we can divide the predicted classifications into the four types presented below on which the basic measures of prediction efficiency are based manning and schütze escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber original predicted class not class other class tp true positive fn false negative not class other fp false positive tn true negative you can then go on to calculate recall and precision or spesificity or sensitivity recall is the proportion of original occurrences of some particular class for which the prediction is correct formula escapenumber below see manning and schütze escapenumber escapenumber formula escapenumber escapenumber whereas precision is the proportion of the all the predictions of some particular class which turn out to be correct formula escapenumber below see manning and schütze escapenumber escapenumber formula escapenumber escapenumber sensitivity is in fact exactly equal to recall whereas specificity is understood as the proportion of non cases correctly predicted or classified as non cases i e rejected formula escapenumber below furthermore there is a third pair of evaluation measures that one could also calculate namely accuracy and error formula escapenumber below manning and schütze escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber recall tp tp fn sensitivity escapenumber precision tp tp fp escapenumber specificity tn tn fn escapenumber accuracy tp tn n diag n k k however as has been noted in some earlier responses these aforementioned general measures do not in any way take into consideration whether prediction and classification according to a model with the help of explanatory variables performs any better than knowing the overall proportions of the outcome classes for this purpose the asymmetric summary measures of association based on proportionate reduction of error pre are good candidates for evaluating prediction accuracy where we expect that the prediction or classification process on the basis of the models should exceed some baselines or thresholds however one cannot use the goodman kruskal lambda and tau as such but make some adjustments to account for the possibility of incorrect prediction with this approach one compares prediction classification errors with the model error model to the baseline level of prediction classification errors without the error model baseline according to formula escapenumber below menard escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber the formula for the error with the model remains the same irrespective of whether we are evaluating prediction or classification accuracy presented in escapenumber but the errors without the model vary according to the intended objective presented in escapenumber and escapenumber subsequently the measure for the proportionate reduction of prediction error is presented in escapenumber below and being analogous to the goodman kruskal lambda it is designated as lambda prediction similarly the measure for proportionate reduction of classification error is presented in escapenumber and being analogous with the goodman kruskal tau it is likewise designated as tau classification for both measures positive values indicate better than baseline classification while negative values worse performance escapenumber error model n sum k escapenumber k n k k n sum diag n where n is the escapelong prediction classification matrix escapenumber error baseline prediction n max r k with r k marginal row sums for each row k of altogether k classes and n the sum total of cases escapenumber

escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber gmt from nathaniel grey however what i really want to know is how well my nueral net is doing at classifying my binary output variable i am new to r and i can't figure out how you can assess the success rates of predictions i've been recently tacking this myself though with respect to polytomous escapenumber outcomes the following approaches are based on menard escapenumber cohen et al escapenumber and manning schütze escapenumber first you have to decide what is the critical probability that you use to classify the cases into class a and consequently not class a the simplest level is escapenumber escapenumber but other levels might also be motivated see e g cohen et al escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber you can then treat the classification task as two distinct types namely classification and prediction models which have an effect on how the efficiency and accuracy of prediction is exactly measured menard escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber in a pure prediction model we set no a priori expectation or constraint on the overall frequencies of the predicted classes to the contrary in a classification model our expectation is that the predicted outcome classes on the long run will end up having the same proportions as are evident in the training data as the starting point for evaluating prediction efficiency is to compile a escapelong prediction classification table frequency counts on the decending diagonal in the table indicate correctly predicted and classified cases whereas all counts off the diagonal are incorrect for the two alternatives overerall we can divide the predicted classifications into the four types presented below on which the basic measures of prediction efficiency are based manning and schütze escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber original predicted class not class other class tp true positive fn false negative not class other fp false positive tn true negative you can then go on to calculate recall and precision or spesificity or sensitivity recall is the proportion of original occurrences of some particular class for which the prediction is correct formula escapenumber below see manning and schütze escapenumber escapenumber formula escapenumber escapenumber whereas precision is the proportion of the all the predictions of some particular class which turn out to be correct formula escapenumber below see manning and schütze escapenumber escapenumber formula escapenumber escapenumber sensitivity is in fact exactly equal to recall whereas specificity is understood as the proportion of non cases correctly predicted or classified as non cases i e rejected formula escapenumber below furthermore there is a third pair of evaluation measures that one could also calculate namely accuracy and error formula escapenumber below manning and schütze escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber recall tp tp fn sensitivity escapenumber precision tp tp fp escapenumber specificity tn tn fn escapenumber accuracy tp tn n diag n k k however as has been noted in some earlier responses these aforementioned general measures do not in any way take into consideration whether prediction and classification according to a model with the help of explanatory variables performs any better than knowing the overall proportions of the outcome classes for this purpose the asymmetric summary measures of association based on proportionate reduction of error pre are good candidates for evaluating prediction accuracy where we expect that the prediction or classification process on the basis of the models should exceed some baselines or thresholds however one cannot use the goodman kruskal lambda and tau as such but make some adjustments to account for the possibility of incorrect prediction with this approach one compares prediction classification errors with the model error model to the baseline level of prediction classification errors without the error model baseline according to formula escapenumber below menard escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber the formula for the error with the model remains the same irrespective of whether we are evaluating prediction or classification accuracy presented in escapenumber but the errors without the model vary according to the intended objective presented in escapenumber and escapenumber subsequently the measure for the proportionate reduction of prediction error is presented in escapenumber below and being analogous to the goodman kruskal lambda it is designated as lambda prediction similarly the measure for proportionate reduction of classification error is presented in escapenumber and being analogous with the goodman kruskal tau it is likewise designated as tau classification for both measures positive values indicate better than baseline classification while negative values worse performance escapenumber error model n sum k escapenumber k n k k n sum diag n where n is the escapelong prediction classification matrix escapenumber error baseline prediction n max r k with r k marginal row sums for each row k of altogether k classes and n the sum total of cases escapenumber

rival to buy enron , top energy trader , after financial fall

c . 2 new york times company
with its stock plunging and its finances in doubt , the world ' s largest energy trader , the enron corporation , agreed to be acquired yesterday by the rival dynegy inc . for about $ 9 billion in stock and the assumption of $ 13 billion in debt .
the deal is an extraordinary turnabout for enron , a houston - based company that had been a driving force behind electricity deregulation nationwide .
its chairman , kenneth l . lay , a big contributor to the republican party , provided political influence , while its former chief executive , jeffrey k . skilling , helped create markets for the trading of electricity and natural gas . but last winter , when california ' s effort to deregulate the electricity market led to soaring power prices and rolling blackouts , enron was the subject of much criticism and political anger .
recent disclosures of discrepancies in enron ' s financial statements and an investigation by the securities and exchange commission caused the shares to plunge this week to their lowest level in a decade . as other companies became wary of doing business with it , enron - - also facing a potential cash squeeze - - apparently had little choice but to find a buyer , and a deal was hastily cobbled together this week .
for critics who had complained about enron ' s market power and its dominance , the combination poses additional concerns . dynegy ' s acquisition of enron will be reviewed by state and federal agencies , led by the justice department and the federal energy regulatory commission . analysts said today that they expected scrutiny of the combined companies ' holdings in california , where dynegy owns power - generating plants and enron accounts for much of the trading of natural gas - - fuel for the state ' s electric power plants .
buying enron at a deep discount - - it has lost $ 60 billion in market value this year - - could make dynegy the dominant trader of electricity and natural gas . but the agreement carries big risks as well . along with enron ' s gas pipelines and high - technology trading floor , dynegy will take on enron ' s substantial debt and a web of complex transactions that enron has spun over the last decade .
in addition to the $ 13 billion in debt that enron carries on its books , it has guaranteed at least $ 4 billion in off - balance sheet loans , and the hidden debt could total as much as $ 10 billion , said carol coale , a stock analyst with prudential securities .
charles l . watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , said yesterday that dynegy could sort through enron ' s tangled finances . ' ' we know the company well , ' ' mr . watson said . ' ' it ' s not like we just started fresh . i ' m confident that it ' s as solid as we thought it was . ' '
the new company will combine enron ' s 25 , 000 - mile natural gas pipeline system with the large number of power plants that dynegy owns worldwide , as well as illinois power , a dynegy subsidiary that serves 650 , 000 customers in illinois . but its most important asset will be its trading desk . it will be the largest energy trader in the nation , trading more than twice as much power and natural gas as its closest competitors .
mr . watson said the company did not expect to sell significant properties and that the deal should pass regulatory scrutiny . ' ' there ' s really not a lot of overlap in assets , ' ' he said .
mr . watson and steve bergstrom , dynegy ' s president , will hold those positions in the new company , which will be called dynegy and remain in houston . mr . lay , who created enron in the mid - 1980 ' s , will not have any role in the combined company ' s daily operations . he has been asked to join its board but has not provided an answer . ' ' the last three weeks haven ' t been a lot of fun , ' ' he said .
in a statement announcing the agreement yesterday afternoon , mr . watson said he was confident that the merger would produce a strong new company . ' ' enron is the ideal strategic partner for dynegy , ' ' mr . watson said . ' ' we will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key priorities . ' '
to shore up enron ' s finances , dynegy will immediately put $ 1 . 5 billion into enron through chevrontexaco , the giant oil company , which already owns 27 percent of dynegy . another billion dollars will be injected once the deal is completed .
investors appeared comfortable yesterday that dynegy could make the deal work . after falling $ 3 , to $ 33 , on wednesday , when the companies first said they were in discussions , dynegy rose $ 5 . 76 on thursday and yesterday to close the week at $ 38 . 76 .
' ' on paper , it works , ' ' ms . coale of prudential said . ' ' the combined company would be the leading trader , the market leader in most of their businesses . ' ' ms . coale , who has a sell rating on enron and a buy rating on dynegy , said she planned to keep her buy rating on dynegy .
as it works to have the deal approved , dynegy will have to persuade enron ' s traders to stay with the combined company . the pain of the stock ' s 90 percent plunge this year will not be equally shared . some enron employees have held onto their shares and seen their retirement accounts eviscerated . meanwhile , mr . lay , mr . skilling and other former and current executives sold hundreds of millions of dollars in enron stock in 2000 and this year .
the companies also have very different corporate cultures . dynegy emphasizes teamwork , while enron is more competitive , said ehud ronn , director of the center for energy finance education and research at the university of texas . even before the merger was announced , enron had lost some of its employees to other energy trading companies , mr . ronn said .
some investors and analysts say that the problems with enron ' s finances may extend beyond the partnerships that have been the subject of wall street ' s scrutiny the last month . james chanos , a short - seller who has been one of enron ' s most vocal critics , said there was increasing evidence that enron ' s energy trading operations were not as profitable as the company had said . ' ' there appears to be a culture at enron of aggressively booking profits and deferring or obscuring losses , ' ' mr . chanos said .
on thursday , enron said in a filing with the s . e . c that it had overstated its earnings by almost $ 600 million over the last five years . mr . chanos said more restatements were possible , noting that the filing disclosed partnerships had been used to hedge almost $ 1 billion in losses in 2000 and this year . so far , the losses from those partnerships remain off enron ' s financial statements , mr . chanos said .
enron ' s stock had been under pressure for most of this year , as the company ran up large losses with failed efforts to expand outside its core trading operation . in august , mr . skilling resigned as chief executive , and mr . lay resumed control of daily operations .
still , the company appeared financially sound until last month , when it disclosed that its shareholders ' equity , a measure of the company ' s value , dropped by $ 1 . 2 billion because of deals disclosed only hazily in its financial statements . the announcement unnerved investors , who wondered whether enron had found ways to inflate its profits and move debt off its balance sheet , and led the s . e . c . to begin an investigation .
mr . lay tried to reassure investors that enron ' s finances were in order and that its businesses remained strong . but the last three weeks have brought a series of damaging revelations about partnerships that enron formed with some of its top executives , including its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow .
with questions mounting , the major credit - rating agencies began to downgrade enron ' s debt , putting additional pressure on the company . if enron ' s debt rating falls below investment grade , it would be forced to repay $ 3 . 3 billion in loans that it had guaranteed .
to strengthen its balance sheet and bolster its stock , enron turned to big investors like warren e . buffett in search of billions of dollars of financing . when the financing did not quickly appear , its stock fell further .
by this week , some major energy traders were refusing to extend credit to enron , worrying that the company would be unable to make good on its contracts . the mirant corporation , an atlanta - based power plant owner and electricity trader , sharply curtailed its trading with enron this week . ' ' we ' re trading with them on a very limited basis , ' ' said james peters , a mirant spokesman . ' ' it ' s not business as usual . ' '
on wednesday , enron ' s stock fell as low as $ 7 a share , its lowest level in more than a decade . that day , news of the enron and dynegy talks leaked out .
by late wednesday , the boards of the two companies had tentatively agreed to a deal . but dynegy refused to go ahead until it learned whether enron ' s credit rating would remain investment grade and was comfortable with the effect of the deal on its own rating . the deal moved forward yesterday after dynegy was assured enron ' s debt was not in danger of being lowered to junk status soon after the deal was announced , according to company officials .
dynegy and enron had provided standard & poor ' s and moody ' s investors service , the main credit agencies , with statements showing them what a combined company might look like and asked the ratings agencies for an expedited review of the transaction , mr . watson said .
under the deal , enron shareholders will receive 0 . 2685 share of dynegy stock for each enron share , or $ 9 . 80 based on dynegy ' s closing price on thursday . enron ' s stock gained 22 cents yesterday , to $ 8 . 63 .
' ' i never thought our stock price would be at this level , ' ' mr . lay said yesterday .
enron ' s shareholders will own only 36 percent of the combined company , and dynegy will name at least 11 members of the company ' s 14 - member board .
if the deal falls apart , enron or dynegy will have to pay a breakup fee of $ 350 million .
to protect dynegy ' s and chevrontexaco ' s cash infusion , the money will go to an enron unit that owns the northern natural gas pipeline . if the merger is not completed , dynegy will have the right to buy the unit .
an army of bankers and lawyers advised the companies . lehman brothers inc . acted as financial adviser and baker botts and akin , gump , strauss , hauer & feld acted as counsel for dynegy . j . p . morgan & company and salomon smith barney acted as financial advisers for enron , and vinson & elkins and weil gotshal & manges acted as the company ' s counsel . pillsbury winthrop served as counsel to chevrontexaco .

regulators struggle with a marketplace created by enron

c . 2001 new york times company
washington , nov . 9 - - for years , the enron corporation used its political muscle to build the markets in which it thrived , pushing relentlessly on capitol hill and in bureaucratic backwaters to deregulate the nation ' s natural gas and electricity businesses .
its achievement , as one enron executive said today , in creating a ' ' regulatory black hole ' ' fit nicely with what he called the company ' s ' ' core management philosophy , which was to be the first mover into a market and to make money in the initial chaos and lack of transparency . ' '
now , wall street ' s dissatisfaction with enron ' s secretive ways has delivered the company into the arms of its much smaller houston rival , dynegy inc . , in a deal worth about $ 9 billion in stock and the assumption of $ 13 billion in debt . the combination of the two companies , energy experts and lawmakers said today , poses a novel set of challenges for regulators still struggling to grasp the complexities of the marketplace that enron invented .
' ' we ' re in a supersonic - speed era of electronic trading with a horse - and - buggy - era regulatory system to protect consumers , ' ' said representative edward j . markey , a massachusetts democrat who has devised legislation to close the regulatory gap .
dynegy ' s acquisition of enron is expected to be reviewed by numerous state and federal agencies , led by the justice department , the federal trade commission and the federal energy regulatory commission .
analysts said today that sharp scrutiny would be given to the combined companies ' holdings in california , where dynegy owns generating plants and enron controls a large part of the market for trading natural gas - - the fuel for a big share of the state ' s electric power plants .
' ' dynegy would now have a greater ability to take the dominant position in gas and raise the price of electricity , ' ' said frank wolak , a professor of economics at stanford university .
mr . wolak , a consultant to the justice department on a 1999 antitrust case that led to limits on another merger of electricity and natural gas companies in southern california , said he was skeptical that regulators were up to the task of reviewing today ' s deal .
the transaction ' ' is something the department of justice needs to look at , and they are going to have a hard time looking at , ' ' mr . wolak said . ' ' and it ' s beyond the ability of the f . e . r . c . to look at . ' '
pat wood - - named chairman of the federal energy commission earlier this year with the backing of kenneth l . lay , the chairman of enron - - acknowledged in an interview today that the agency had ' ' a long way to go ' ' in matching the sophistication of the companies it regulates .
but he said that the commission had made great strides in grappling with the new risk management techniques pioneered by enron , dynegy and other energy companies . it is hiring more experts , he said , adopting more restrictive rules on how much ' ' market power ' ' one party can control and requiring more disclosure of certain energy transactions .
in an interview this evening , charles l . watson , the chairman of dynegy , said he did not believe that regulators reviewing the deal with enron would require the sale of any assets . ' ' we haven ' t really identified any pitfalls that require any sort of asset divestiture , ' ' he said . ' ' there ' s not really any overlap . ' '
a senior executive at one of enron ' s largest energy - trading rivals disagreed . ' ' i don ' t think this deal gets through unscathed , ' ' he said today . ' ' i ' m sure the justice department and the f . t . c . will look closely at the pretty substantial concentration of market power these companies will have in the energy - trading area . ' '
enron is mainly a trader of natural gas and electricity - - indeed , the biggest player in both those markets - - and it also owns a network of gas pipelines . dynegy processes and sells natural gas and generates and sells electricity . each company owns a local electric utility , too : dynegy owns illinois power in decatur , ill . , while enron owns portland general electric in portland , ore . , but last month announced plans to sell it to another oregon utility .
for a decade , as it transformed itself from a gas pipeline operator into the nation ' s biggest energy trader , enron enjoyed unalloyed lobbying success in washington and the enthusiastic backing of wall street .
in the early months of the bush administration , mr . lay - - whose company was one of the biggest financial backers of george w . bush ' s presidential campaign - - played a prominent , and some said unusual , role in helping the white house pick nominees to the federal energy commission . enron executives met with vice president dick cheney , whose energy task force backed many of the deregulatory initiatives pushed by mr . lay .
now , ' ' the company has become a pariah , ' ' an enron executive said today . ' ' the bush administration doesn ' t want to have anything to do with us . ' '
the problems began with the energy crisis in california , where enron ' s outspoken defense of deregulation , even more than its electricity trading activities , made the company a favorite whipping boy of politicians and consumer advocates . in the financial markets , meanwhile , enron ' s confusing disclosures , tolerated when its stock was soaring , drew disdain as the calming of the energy storms in california and other parts of the country beat the shares down , starting last spring .
' ' enron fell victim to their own inconsistencies on transparency , ' ' mr . wolak said . as california officials sought to understand why energy prices had soared out of control , he said , enron ' s ' ' view was that we want everybody ' s data , but if you want ours , get a subpoena . ' '
energy executives and regulators said that sort of arrogance had long marked enron ' s attitude about government oversight .
electricity sales had for decades been the job of local utility companies , operating as monopolies and selling power at regulated rates within their service areas . a few entrepreneurs , led by mr . lay , conceived a different model in which power could be sold by generators or middlemen to big corporate users or utilities in faraway regions , at whatever price the market would bear .
in the early 1990 ' s , congress - - under heavy lobbying by enron - - passed legislation that began to open up electricity sales to marketers . before long , enron became one of the first companies to receive government approval to sell electricity at market rates . the market for interstate sales of natural gas had been freed up a few years earlier , and critics complained that traders like enron were gleaning their profits by stoking volatility in gas prices .
in the mid - 1990 ' s , independent gas producers backed legislation in congress to allow the creation of a co - operative marketing organization , which , they hoped , would have helped stabilize prices .
raymond plank , the chairman of the apache corporation , a gas producer based in houston , said that the big gas marketing and trading companies , including enron , successfully lobbied to kill the plan , leaving prices as volatile as ever .
' ' it was a great concept , ' ' mr . plank said . ' ' we could have headed off the problems we have today . ' '
enron ' s final lobbying success came last year . with a strong push from the company ' s lobbyists , congress passed futures trading legislation that exempted internet energy trading platforms like enrononline , the industry leader , from oversight by the commodity futures trading commission . enron takes the other side of trades on its exchange . in traditional markets like the new york mercantile exchange , which remain subject to oversight , the exchange acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers .
under mr . watson , dynegy has been less of a pathbreaker than enron , and though california politicians denounced it , too , as a profiteer during the energy crisis , most analysts say it has been less aggressive than enron in both its business practices and its lobbying .
indeed , the rival energy - trading executive today predicted ' ' a huge culture clash ' ' as the houston neighbors merge . ' ' blood will flow in houston over the integration of the trading operation , ' ' he said .
but regulators may find dynegy easier to deal with .
earlier this year , the federal energy commission asked for comments on whether it should tighten scrutiny of dealings between natural gas pipelines and energy - trading shops owned by the same company .
enron wondered what all the bother was . ' ' would stricter rules prevent real affiliate abuse that current rules do not , ' ' it wrote in a regulatory filing , ' ' or would they instead merely restrict the activities of some of the more successful participants in the marketplace ? ' '
dynegy , by contrast , painted a grim picture and invited regulators to crack down . ' ' abuses abound , ' ' it said , ' ' because of financial windfalls , difficulty of detection , lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the market . ' '

companies in return chevrontexaco will be granted rights over $ 1 . 5 bn of dynegy stock .
jp morgan chase and citigroup demanded similar security for a $ 1 bn loan extended this month .
moody ' s investors service cut its rating on enron ' s senior unsecured debt yesterday morning from baa 2 to baa 3 - just one notch above junk status . any deeper downgrade would have forced enron to sell stock to cover about $ 3 . 3 bn of obligations , and could have deterred dynegy . moody ' s kept the ratings under review for further downgrades , given "" the potential for increased margin requirements from counterparties "" .
however , the agency said it would treat a substantial capital injection as "" a stabilising event "" . the deal is likely to face intense regulatory scrutiny , given the large share the combined companies would have in the energy markets .
the bid represents a reversal of fortune for enron , which will effectively be humbled by its smaller houston rival . however , some analysts expressed reservations , as enron faces a securities and exchange commission inquiry into off - balance sheet transactions , and a restatement of its accounts has yet to clear up questions about the true state of its financial dealings .
carol coale , of prudential securities , said : "" we believe that either dynegy had material exposure to enron ' s trading contracts or that it is trying to rescue its competitor by saving the liquidity in the commodities markets . ""

arthur andersen , enron ' s auditor , is understood to have approved the controversial off - balance sheet arrangements that lie at the heart of the energy company ' s decision to overhaul its accounts earlier this week .
however , in at least one case the auditor may not have been given full information , while the involvement in the disputed transactions of four people employed by enron has only recently come to light . andersen has already been hit by lawsuits from enron shareholders filed in oregon and harris county , texas - a popular venue among plaintiffs ' lawyers given its history of big jury awards .
the legal actions are the latest blow to an auditing profession still reeling in the aftermath of a series of accounting scandals that have blown up in recent years . on wednesday , waste management said andersen would pay $ 20 m to settle a suit brought by shareholders in the trash hauler alleging professional malpractice . the securities and exchange commission has already agreed a $ 7 m settlement with andersen over the alleged audit fraud .
the enron actions could also turn out to be one of the first tests of new auditor independence rules set by the sec . the energy company paid andersen $ 25 m for its audit last year and $ 27 m for other services .
an andersen spokesman refused to comment on whether the auditor had vetted the complex off - balance sheet arrangements used by enron to manage its trading risks and offload debt . however , he added : "" we do help companies understand accounting rules and how to apply them . ""
in a regulatory filing on thursday , enron indicated that its decision to restate its accounts to include two off - balance companies was based on "" current information "" , suggesting that full details had not been available before .
however , a third accounting change was based on a new "" assessment "" , enron said , raising questions about the auditor ' s earlier judgement .
under the previous commissioner arthur levitt , the sec attacked companies that indulged in "" earnings management "" and accountants who suffered from conflicts of interest between audit and consulting work . the accounting firms say audit and consulting work can co - exist .

being in the business , dynegy should have a better idea than other possible buyers of what it is taking on . presumably it has been given a fuller and franker explanation of enron ' s off - balance - sheet mess than its investors , but it can scarcely have been able to carry out what normally counts as due diligence .
moody ' s decision and s & p ' s indecision meant enron kept its investment grade and seems to have got the deal done . do ratings agencies really provide independent analysis at these times ? if dynegy injects $ 1 . 5 bn of cash up front , courtesy of chevron texaco and secured on the pipeline assets , that averts the immediate crisis . an exchange ratio of 0 . 27 would value enron ' s stock at $ 8 bn . at about $ 10 . 67 a share that is a 27 per cent premium , but more pertinently compares with $ 34 on the eve of the october earnings call and $ 83 on new year ' s day . there are no rivals for this year ' s prize for shareholder value destruction . others have gone , but did ken lay , enron chief executive , know what was going on ? whatever the answer , it reflects poorly on him .
the merger raises antitrust questions . dynegy might be a fifth of enron ' s size , but it is the second biggest energy trader . but while enron has few friends in the public markets it still has some in high places . dynegy ' s offer puts a floor beneath enron ' s share price . paying bottom dollar provides some insurance for its shareholders . as more emerges on the financial structure and the state of the core trading business , the question is whether those who declined the opportunity start to take an interest or pat themselves on the back .

companies continental has had to lay off 12 , 000 employees ; and energy trader enron has gone from being the leader of houston ' s business community to its biggest liability .
the fourth most populous city in the us is reeling from the latest demise among its corporate citizens .
"" it ' s a body blow , "" says charlie savino , executive vice - president of the greater houston partnership , a business organisation .
enron is not only one of the city ' s biggest employers ; it has led the redevelopment of downtown houston , making it somewhere pleasant to live for the first time in decades .
at the centre of its efforts is the enron field , which the company financed to bring professional baseball - and its fans - back into the city centre .
on the periphery are enron ' s contributions to houston ' s social development .
the company matches all employee donations made to non - profit organisations , for up to $ 15 , 000 per employee , per year .
it also makes donations to non - profit organisations for which its employees offer their time .
kenneth lay , enron chief executive , has long been the "" go - to guy "" to get something done in houston .
enron ' s status brought houston status ; as the biggest energy trader in the us , it made the city the centre of energy trading . enrononline , its internet trading platform , has drawn some of the brightest minds to the city to work on what has become the world ' s biggest web - based transaction system .
enron was so secure in its standing that it was building a new 40 - storey office building adjoining its 50 - storey tower .
beside that , bulldozers and cranes have been putting the finishing touches to a massive new parking garage .
employees had just started to move into the new towers when a series of disclosures about enron ' s financial position began to undermine the company and send investors fleeing for cover .
enron staff , once known for being both brilliant and arrogant enough to prove it , are coping with their dramatic reversal in status in a wide variety of ways .
as they left work yesterday , many brushed by in their smart - casual polo shirts and khakis , refusing to say a word about what was unfolding .
one man , looking exhausted , braved a grin and said : "" just keep smiling . the world goes on . companies go through problems all the time , just like we do in personal life . ""
one woman felt she had to laugh at the irony : she moved to enron last year to protect herself from job losses in the more traditional energy businesses . at that time , enron was considered the safest place to be in the industry .
that dynegy , another houston - based energy trader , has emerged as enron ' s saviour is being received positively by staff , who praised its technology and processes .
the houston business community may be hoping that a merged group might be better for the city than a stand - alone enron , as a combined business would be bigger and stronger .
but john olson , of sanders morris harris , a local investment banking and securities firm in houston , notes that a merger is likely to lead to job losses , as assets are sold and businesses are streamlined .
already , he says , many houston citizens , big holders of enron ' s stock , had lost out on its share slide . "" the ripple effects on the city will be immeasurable , "" he says .

copyright ? 2000 dow jones enron has more than 7 , 000 here .
for watson , the deal is all about growth .
"" it accelerates our strategy some three or four years , "" he said shortly after the deal was announced . "" this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies . ""
this isn ' t the way ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , ever thought his years of work would turn out .
"" this would not have been my dream case , "" lay said in an interview with the chronicle shortly after the deal was announced . "" i would not even have contemplated it three or four weeks ago . ""
lay has been offered a seat on the combined company ' s board , but hasn ' t decided yet whether to take it . he won ' t have any management role once the deal closes .
he helped take enron from a staid pipeline company created from a 1985 merger to a trading machine that wheels and deals in gas , electricity , financial contracts used to help companies manage risk and other commodities .
but lay said he believed selling enron was the best option for its shareholders , employees and the city considering the company ' s current battered state .
"" this is the best way to provide certainty to protect this wholesale marketing and trading franchise which is so valuable , "" he said , adding that enron looked at two or three other alternatives as it tried to strengthen its balance sheet and add cash into its operations .
lay said it ' s not his preference to sell enron and see its name disappear .
"" it happens to be the best alternative , "" said lay . "" i ' m a realist . i knew what needed to be done . ""
among enron ' s troubles : the securities and exchange commission is investigating business deals enron did with two investment partnerships run by its former chief financial officer , its credibility on wall street is close to zero , a pile of shareholder lawsuits and its credit rating , which it relies on to successfully run its core trading business , has been lowered .
while other questions had hung over enron earlier this year , the path to its end really began oct . 16 , when the company released third - quarter earnings and reported significant financial losses related to the two investment partnerships .
that set in motion a spiral of events leading to friday ' s announcement .
watson called lay on oct . 24 to see if he could do anything to help dispel rumors that dynegy had stopped trading with enron .
that conversation led to a meeting at lay ' s house three days later , at which the two started talking about a deal .
as these things go , the deal came together quickly , especially with so many question marks hanging over enron .
"" i think it ' s important to understand that ken and i have known each other for some 20 years , "" watson said . "" we have a good understanding of what they do and how they do it . we knew that their franchise was solid . ""
under the terms of the deal , which is expected to close in six to nine months :
enron shareholder ' s get 0 . 2685 share of dynegy per enron share . based on friday ' s closing stock prices of $ 8 . 63 for enron and $ 38 . 76 for dynegy , dynegy is paying $ 10 . 41 an enron share - or a 21 percent premium . that ' s a far cry from late january when enron ' s closing price hit $ 82 a share .
dynegy will immediately inject $ 1 . 5 billion in enron to help shore it up . dynegy will get that money from chevrontexaco , which owns about 26 percent of dynegy .
in return for that money , dynegy will get preferred stock and other rights in enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline system . should the deal not close , dynegy has the right to buy all of northern natural gas .
at the deal ' s closing , chevrontexaco will provide another $ 1 billion to the combined company .
enron will have the right to designate at least three board members for the combined company , which will have 14 board seats .
steve bergstrom , dynegy ' s president , and rob doty , dynegy ' s chief financial officer , will keep those roles in the new company . greg whalley , currently president and chief operating officer of enron , will become an executive vice president at the combined company .
the deal contains a $ 350 million breakup fee that dynegy would get if another suitor came in and enron decided to take a better offer .
watson also said the deal contains escape clauses to protect dynegy should it be necessary , but he doesn ' t expect any surprises .
"" we looked under the hood and guess what , it ' s just as strong as we thought it was , "" he said .
the deal must be reviewed by a variety of government regulators , though watson isn ' t expecting any antitrust problems .
dynegy will talk to analysts and investors on a conference call monday , attempting to convince them of the deal ' s value . dynegy expects the merger to result in $ 400 million to $ 500 million in annual savings .
"" on paper , it looks good , "" said coale , the analyst . "" we still remain concerned about the uncertainties that shroud enron . . . the risks continue to be what we don ' t know about enron . we just hope chuck and his team do all the necessary due diligence , which is going to take more than a couple weeks . ""
there are also concerns about merging two different cultures .
"" looking at cultures , the two companies are very different , "" she said . "" dynegy is a little bit of a fraternity . chuck started this company and i ' m sure he has a heartfelt emotion toward making things work at dynegy . enron is a mercenary , aggressive , cutthroat culture . ""
while both are energy traders , enron has pursued a strategy of shedding assets , while dynegy has continued to make asset purchases .
at the start of the year , enron was still heralded as an innovator for others to emulate . since , a series of problems began chipping away at enron ' s image .
but such concerns were mostly pushed aside for as long as the company ' s stock price performed well and its core energy trading business turned out higher and still - higher profits .
the company ' s woes became more serious and quickly multiplied after it made troubling financial disclosures in its third - quarter earnings report oct . 16 .
it disclosed that day it had taken a $ 35 million loss and reduced shareholders equity by $ 1 . 2 billion related to ending business dealings with two investment partnerships formerly run by andrew fastow , its chief financial officer .
the disclosures heightened wall street ' s ongoing concerns that enron ' s financial reporting was too difficult to understand and skimped on details . it also led to fears that enron would be on the hook for billions of dollars related to other financial vehicles .
days later , enron revealed that the sec was investigating transactions between enron and the partnerships , called ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment . it also replaced fastow and has been hit with a growing number of shareholder lawsuits .
then , the company ' s credit rating was downgraded , which raised questions about its ability to manage its core energy trading business .
as wall street ' s questions grew , enron retreated into silence , leaving analysts and investors to speculate on worst - case scenarios , which fed fears that company was facing a cash - crunch and caused investors to keep dumping the stock .
that in turn , led some of enron ' s trading partners to shift business elsewhere and raise their credit requirements to do business with enron , which in turn , raised even more fears .
thursday , enron said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships it created .

the famous baseball manager casey stengel was smart to advise , "" never make predictions , especially about the future , "" ken lay once wrote in an essay on world energy needs .
lay might be taking those words to heart today .
as the chairman of enron corp . predicted not long ago , "" we can see some very significant growth with several years to come . ""
once considered one of the shining stars of the energy business , lay has watched the company he helped create melt down around him in a matter of weeks .
and as of friday , he was left to ponder an offer to serve as a member of the board for the new company formed from enron and its chief rival - no longer a chairman or a chief executive .
perhaps that ' s the way he wants it .
when he turned over the chief executive ' s post at enron to jeffrey skilling earlier this year , it seemed like the first move of his orderly exit from the company he had helped create in the mid - 1980 s .
eleven months later , skilling is gone and lay has had to preside over the death of enron .
what had begun as a stodgy natural gas pipeline company had been molded and expanded by the two men into a diversified financial giant with its hands in countless markets from oil and natural gas to water and broadband .
it seemed lay , 58 , who is an economist by profession , had also cemented his reputation as an elder statesman in the energy industry , the man who had opened the business world ' s eyes to the array of possibilities that energy companies could explore for growth away from their traditional roles .
with the implosion of enron in the past month , lay ' s legacy now seems tarnished . the man who was once referred to as an "" energetic messiah "" has been forced to sell off his creation in a fire sale to rival dynegy in a hastily arranged deal . lay ' s approach is reflected in the design of the building enron is constructing across from its existing tower on smith street . looking down on the massive trading floor are two offices built for lay and skilling .
the offices were considered symbolic of the company ' s openness and its philosophy of melding executives with the rank and file . lay reportedly spurned the express elevator to ride to his 50 th - floor office to spend more time with employees .
that sort of hands - on approach lay brought to the company may be another casualty , analysts said .
"" i would be surprised if he had much of a role in running things from a day - to - day perspective , "" said brian youngberg , energy analyst with edward jones in st . louis . "" i think dynegy will be running the ship and plug in some enron executives . ""
as the dust settles on enron , the question is being raised as to whether the company became too big for one or two men to run in a hands - on fashion .
"" ken lay helped build enron from being just a pipeline company , but over time the company got so big and complex that it was too hard for one or two senior executives to completely oversee things and to know fully what was going on in the operating companies , "" youngberg said .
raised on a farm in missouri , lay is well - known not just as chairman of enron but as a former undersecretary of the interior department and one of the people who has helped shape houston ' s destiny in the past 20 years . he is considered instrumental in keeping major league baseball in houston by supporting the construction of enron field .
but his lasting legacy will likely be as one of the key people who helped create the huge natural gas futures market in the united states , which was nonexistent as recently as the late 1980 s . he also will be remembered as the man who led others to view the energy business as one integrated market and not individual fiefdoms .
"" ken lay really did educate his peers to understand the broadness of his business , "" said amy jaffe , a senior energy analyst with rice university ' s james a . baker iii institute for public policy . "" whether his retirement is under positive or negative circumstances , he has left a huge legacy on the industry . ""
jaffe sees lay as the person who got oil and gas executives to break out of the old mentality and explore new technologies such as fuel cells and wind power . he also was a leading proponent of natural gas and power deregulation .
he will leave enron a wealthy man , although much less so since the company ' s stock nose - dived . his current contract pays him a base salary of $ 1 . 4 million a year and a bonus of $ 7 million . it was due to expire in december 2003 .
this is not the first time lay has had to rescue enron . in 1987 , enron was rocked by the disclosure that rogue traders at its enron oil co . had left the company holding the bag for about $ 1 billion in trading liabilities . before disclosing it to the market , the company worked the trading loss down to about $ 142 million .
"" we learned a lot , certainly in a bad way , "" lay said of the incident in an interview earlier this year . "" we put in place probably the best risk management and control system , not just in our business , but in any industry . ""
some see irony in the fact that dynegy ceo chuck watson will likely prevail over lay despite lay ' s almost cult status among business leaders and business school professors .
"" chuck watson was underrated in his role in forming the natural gas market in the united states . he was the man who realized the enormous potential of the natural gas market , "" jaffe said . "" it ' s true that enron came in with a lot of advertising and built up a big position , but maybe there is some poetic justice that the man who really started the natural gas clearinghouse could wind back up as the dominant player in the industry . ""

"" he doesn ' t act like a big shot , "" said tilman fertitta , the chairman of landry ' s restaurants , who likes driving a bentley and zipping around in a helicopter . "" chuck ' s not all caught up in the houston hustle - and - bustle thing . ""
like it or not , watson is about to step out in a big way . if dynegy completes the acquisition of enron for $ 8 . 85 billion in stock , watson will become captain of houston ' s largest company . he will step right into the center of the city ' s business stage , taking from enron chairman ken lay the mantle of most powerful businessman in a city where commerce and the deal have always come first .
those who know watson say he should have little trouble adapting to his higher profile and is ready for the many demands that will inexorably follow .
"" chuck is a guy who knows what he wants and goes and gets it , "" fertitta said . "" he is not intimidated . ""
in fact , when longtime friend steve patterson read about enron ' s nose - dive and the collapse of its stock , he instinctively knew watson would close in on a deal .
"" i thought : ` you know what , chuck will try to buy enron . it just fits . it ' s the big bold move that chuck would try to make , ' "" said patterson , senior vice president of the houston texans football team . watson owns 15 percent of the texans , the largest chunk outside of the piece owned by club founder bob mcnair . watson also owns the houston aeros hockey team .
like enron chairman ken lay , watson was a pioneer in the deregulation of the energy business . he was one of the early innovative forces that shaped the world of trading electricity and swapping natural gas .
watson was born 51 years ago on the great lakes naval base north of chicago . his father worked for the navy , which moved the young watson clan around early and often . chuck watson had attended more than 20 schools in nine states when he graduated from oklahoma state university in 1972 with a degree in economics .
after a 13 - year career at conoco , watson joined a fledgling company called u . s . natural gas clearinghouse in 1985 . ngc was a consortium of gas pipelines that had the backing of a financial - services company and a local law firm , but conflicts among the partners hamstrung the little company .
watson would not join the company until it was overhauled and most of the quarreling partners were bought out . watson ' s vision was to buy the gas and take title to it , aggregate big volumes and leverage that to make bigger deals and negotiate better rates from the pipelines that moved the gas around .
in short , the company moved beyond being a broker and became a wholesale store for natural gas .
"" he is a visionary in the energy business , "" said bob mcnair , a longtime friend who founded cogen technologies and later sold the company to enron for $ 1 . 1 billion . "" chuck will come across as this relaxed , country person . not some sophisticate . but that is disarming . he is very creative , and he is very smart . ""
while ngc initially concentrated on gathering , moving and trading natural gas , the business has broadened along with the quickening pace of energy deregulation . now called dynegy , short for dynamic energy , the company has evolved into an outfit that sells power directly to commercial and industrial users of electricity and natural gas . it also has built a communications division to capitalize on increasing demand for high - speed communication services .
last year the company recorded an astounding 230 percent rise in net income , as well as a 91 percent jump in operating revenues . dynegy ' s stock climbed 218 percent last year .
"" the success of dynegy is a tremendous story , "" patterson said . "" it is amazing the growth and the value he has been able to achieve . ""
according to some of those who ' ve have done business with him , watson is not just bright , he is extraordinarily tough .
"" he is a very aggressive person , a tough negotiator . he bores in , "" said george mitchell , founder of mitchell energy and the man who carved the woodlands out of the piney forest . "" he is a very confident person . unlike ken lay , who is a smoother type personality who works with people , watson is going to do it his way . they are both very good business people , but they are very different . ""
while willing to give power to his subordinates , watson is a hands - on ceo who is unmistakably dynegy ' s commanding force .
"" chuck is very , very intense . . . he burns , "" said former houston mayor bob lanier . "" in negotiations , he gets down and learns all the details himself . ""
how tough watson is willing to be came to light in his contentious dealings with houston rockets owner les alexander . watson owned the master lease to the summit , later renamed the compaq center , which committed the rockets to playing there through 2003 . eager to break the deal , alexander tried negotiating and litigating his way out of the lease , all to no avail .
the battle deepened as the two men competed unsuccessfully to get a nhl hockey team in houston and feuded over how a hockey team would share in the revenues of a new stadium proposed for downtown .
angered at the deal alexander was able to get for the rockets , at the expense of a hockey franchise , watson spent about $ 100 , 000 out of his own pocket to help defeat the stadium referendum . it was his one overtly political act here , and some say it was the decisive blow to alexander ' s aspirations .
"" there are a lot of people i ' d much rather have a contest with , "" lanier said of watson .
alexander and watson were later able to settle their differences , and watson supported the second arena referendum , which passed . a basketball arena is now under construction downtown .
"" i ' m not surprised to see chuck watson make an aggressive move like this , "" alexander said friday evening . "" he understands the industry as well as anyone ; and therefore , he ' s in the best position to assess the risk and take advantage of the opportunity . ""
like most opportunities , the deal also represents a sizable risk . taking over enron is a huge reach for dynegy , which will try to swallow a company that was five times bigger when measured by revenues .
watson will need all of his shrewdness and ferocity to untangle the mess that is enron and merge two operations that were each , in their own way , trying to reinvent the energy business .
"" i have some concerns for my friend , "" mcnair confessed . "" it is a tremendous challenge . i know he ' ll handle it well , but this will be a very demanding business . ""

enron corp . , the once - highflying energy giant whose aggressive efforts to profit from california ' s energy deregulation made it a target of consumer and political backlash , on friday agreed to be saved from possible financial collapse through a proposed acquisition by rival dynegy inc .
the roughly $ 7 . 7 - billion deal is a stunning plot twist for houston - based enron , which was vilified in california as it was being glorified on wall street . in only the last month , a series of disturbing financial revelations pushed to the edge of ruin this once - powerful company , whose top executives had lectured california on its energy foibles and who influenced the direction of national energy policy .
enron muscled its way to the top of the energy heap using aggressive and , in the end , financially suspect strategies that proved its undoing .
now , the company that late last year had a market value of $ 63 billion is worth one - tenth that and has agreed to be swallowed by a cross - town competitor one - quarter its size . enron ' s proud and influential chairman and chief executive , kenneth l . lay , who became a focus of bitter attacks by california politicians and regulators , would lose his job , as would many others at enron .
even the name would disappear . the combined company would be called dynegy inc . if the deal receives all the necessary regulatory and shareholder approvals .
california officials took no joy in enron ' s fate friday , though there was perhaps some sense of retribution from its many critics in the state .
"" this is basically a rogue corporation , "" said sen . steve peace ( d - el cajon ) , an outspoken critic of enron for years who dealt with the company as he chaired the committee that hammered out the legislative portion of california ' s landmark electricity deregulation plan in 1996 . "" it has from the beginning been a rogue corporation which answered in its mind to a higher law - - a fundamental belief that there are laws of economics that supersede the law of the land . ""
a failed experiment
steve maviglio , spokesman for gov . gray davis , said that although enron was never a major force in california ' s doomed electricity market , it was outspoken in support of deregulation .
"" in a sense , their experiment was much like california ' s experiment - - a failure , "" he said .
said harvey rosenfield , president of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights in santa monica : "" nothing could better illustrate the disaster of deregulation than the fact that one of its biggest proponents , which reaped the reward of deregulation , is suffering the consequences . ""
enron is the world ' s largest energy trader , handling one of four energy deals in the united states through its online trading operation , enrononline . since it reported a surprising third - quarter loss on oct . 16 , partly tied to shadowy investment vehicles , enron has endured a huge loss of investor confidence , which brought on a massive cash crunch and some shrinkage of its trading business .
under the deal announced friday , dynegy , invited in two weeks ago after enron fell short in its efforts to line up new financing , would immediately help enron by pouring $ 1 . 5 billion in cash into the company . the money would be provided by chevrontexaco corp . , the san francisco oil company that owns nearly 27 % of dynegy .
enron shareholders would get 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share , which values the company at about $ 7 . 7 billion based on friday ' s stock close . dynegy shares surged $ 2 . 26 to close at $ 38 . 76 per share on the new york stock exchange ; enron added 22 cents to close at $ 8 . 63 per share , still off 89 % year to date .
if the deal closes in six to nine months , as the parties expect , dynegy and chevrontexaco would invest $ 1 billion additionally in the combined company .
"" this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies , "" said charles l . watson , dynegy chairman and chief executive , who will head the combined company . watson said the merger would immediately add to dynegy ' s earnings .
even so , the repercussions of enron ' s fall from grace could be far - reaching . coming on the heels of california ' s energy crisis , enron ' s troubles may slow the country ' s march toward energy deregulation , which lay and enron championed for years as a potential boon to consumers and the economy in general .
but the deal announced friday will prevent an even worse outcome , energy experts said : the threatened collapse of enron , which would clog up for a time the business of buying and selling electricity , natural gas and oil . that could interfere with delivery of energy around the country , they said .

for watson , the deal is all about growth .
"" it accelerates our strategy some three or four years , "" he said shortly after the deal was announced . "" this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies . ""
this isn ' t the way ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , ever thought his years of work would turn out .
"" this would not have been my dream case , "" lay said in an interview with the chronicle shortly after the deal was announced . "" i would not even have contemplated it three or four weeks ago . ""
lay has been offered a seat on the combined company ' s board , but hasn ' t decided yet whether to take it . he won ' t have any management role once the deal closes .
he helped take enron from a staid pipeline company created from a 1985 merger to a trading machine that wheels and deals in electricity gas , electricity , financial contracts used to help companies manage risk and other commodities .
but lay said he believed selling enron was the best option for its shareholders , employees and the city considering the company ' s current battered state .
"" this is the best way to provide certainty to protect this wholesale marketing and trading franchise which is so valuable , "" he said , adding that enron looked at two or three other alternatives as it tried to strengthen its balance sheet and add cash to into its operations .
lay said it ' s not his preference to sell enron and see its name disappear .
"" it happens to be the best alternative , "" said lay . "" i ' m a realist . i knew what needed to be done . ""
among enron ' s troubles : the securities and exchange commission is investigating business deals enron did with two investment partnerships run by its former chief financial officer , its credibility on wall street is close to zero , a pile of shareholder lawsuits and its credit rating , which it relies on to successfully run its core trading business , has been lowered .
while other questions had hung over enron earlier this year , the path to its end really began oct . 16 , when the company released third - quarter earnings and reported significant financial losses related to the two investment partnerships .
that set in a motion a spiral of events leading to friday ' s announcement .
watson called lay on oct . 24 to see if he could do anything to help dispel rumors that dynegy had stopped trading with enron .
that conversation led to a meeting at lay ' s house days later , at which the two started talking about a deal .
as these things go , the deal came together quickly , especially with so many question marks hanging over enron .
"" i think it ' s important to understand that ken and i have known each other for some 20 years , "" watson said . "" we have a good understanding of what they do and how they do it . we knew that their franchise was solid . ""
the recent talks , watson said , focused on really understanding enron ' s core business and how it could merge with dynegy .
added lay : "" good deals come together fast . bad deals take a little longer . ""
under the terms of the deal , which is expected to close in six to nine months :
enron shareholder ' s get 0 . 2685 share of dynegy per enron share .
dynegy will immediately inject $ 1 . 5 billion in enron to help shore it up . dynegy will get that money from chevrontexaco , which owns about 26 percent of dynegy .
in return for that money , dynegy will get preferred stock and other rights in enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline system . should the deal not close , dynegy has the right to buy all of northern natural gas .
at the deal ' s closing , chevrontexaco will provide another $ 1 billion to the combined company .
also at the closing , dynegy ' s current shareholders will own about 64 percent of the combined company , with enron ' s current shareholder ' s owning about 36 percent .
enron will have the right to designate at least three board members for the combined company , which will have 14 board seats .
steve bergstrom , dynegy ' s president , and rob doty , dynegy ' s chief financial officer , will keep those roles in the new company . greg whalley , currently president and chief operating officer of enron , will became an executive vice president at the combined company .
the deal contains $ 350 million breakup free that dynegy would get it another suitor came in and enron decided to take a better offer .
watson also said the deal contains escape clauses to protect dynegy should it be necessary , but he doesn ' t expect any surprises .
"" we looked under the hood and guess what , it ' s just as strong as we thought it was , "" he said .
dynegy will talk to analysts and investors on a conference call monday , attempting to convince them of the deal ' s value .
"" on paper , it looks good , "" said coale , the analyst . "" we still remain concerned about the uncertainties that shroud enron . . . the risks continue to be what we don ' t know about enron . we just hope chuck and his team do all the necessary due diligence , which is going to take more than a couple weeks . ""
there are also concerns about merging two different cultures .
"" looking at cultures , the two companies are very different , "" she said . "" dynegy is a little bit of a fraternity . chuck started this company and i ' m sure he has a heartfelt emotion toward making things work at dynegy . enron is a mercenary , aggressive , cutthroat culture . ""
at the start of the year , enron was still heralded as an innovator for others to emulate . since , a series of problems began chipping away at enron ' s image .
but such concerns were mostly pushed aside for as long as the company ' s stock price performed well and its core energy trading business turned out higher and still - higher profits .
the company ' s woes became more serious and quickly multiplied after it made troubling financial disclosures in its third - quarter earnings report oct . 16 .
it disclosed that day it had taken a $ 35 million loss and reduced shareholders equity by $ 1 . 2 billion related to ending business dealings with two investment partnerships formerly run by andrew fastow , its chief financial officer .
the disclosures heightened wall street ' s ongoing concerns that enron ' s financial reporting was too difficult to understand and skimped on details . it also led to fears that enron would be on the hook for billions of dollars related to other financial vehicles .
days later , enron revealed that the sec was investigating transactions between enron and the partnerships , called ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment . it also replaced fastow and has been hit with a growing number of shareholder lawsuits .
then , the company ' s credit rating was downgraded , which raised questions about its ability to manage its core energy trading business .
as wall street ' s questions grew , enron retreated into silence , leaving analysts and investors to speculate on worst - case scenarios , which fed fears that company was facing a cash - crunch and caused investors to keep dumping the stock .
that in turn , led some of enron ' s trading partners to shift business elsewhere and raise their credit requirements to do business with enron , which in turn , raised even more fears about a cash - crunch and the company ' s short - term stability .
thursday , enron said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships it created .

embattled enron corp . yesterday accepted a buyout offer valued at about $ 8 billion from crosstown rival dynegy inc . if the deal is completed , it would end houston - based enron ' s reign as the leader in the huge energy trading markets that set the prices of power and natural gas in the nation .
its cash dwindling and its credit rating hammered , enron was forced to the negotiating table after its recent disclosures that its obligations to a complex web of partnerships involving company officials had caused the trading powerhouse to overstate its earnings and obscure its total debt obligations . four top enron officials have resigned or been replaced since july and , once dynegy takes control , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , kenneth lay , will also leave the company . lay said yesterday that he had not decided whether to accept dynegy ' s offer to serve on the combined company ' s board .
"" it ' s been a good ride for a long time , "" lay said in a conference call last night . "" the last three weeks haven ' t been a whole lot of fun . ""
the final deal was announced after the close of stock trading . enron ' s shares - - which had fallen from $ 33 to $ 8 after the disclosures - - ended the day slightly higher , at $ 8 . 63 . dynegy ' s stock closed at $ 38 . 76 , up $ 2 . 26 .
dynegy offered all stock for the enron shares , so the total value of the deal will fluctuate with dynegy ' s stock price . dynegy also said it would assume about $ 13 billion in enron debt , bringing the total value of the transaction to around $ 21 billion .
dynegy ' s rescue of enron will begin with an immediate cash infusion of $ 1 . 5 billion , which will be supplied by chevrontexaco corp . , a major dynegy stockholder . chevrontexaco will invest another $ 1 billion in dynegy after the acquisition has passed regulatory review and is completed , which executives said they expect will take six to nine months as enron tries to unscramble the complex partnerships that are now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission .
the takeover agreement gives dynegy an escape clause permitting it to cancel the purchase if enron winds up with heavy regulatory fines or legal judgments from shareholder suits tied to its handling of the partnerships .
chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , said in the conference call that a close scrutiny over the past two weeks of enron ' s financial condition convinced him that the company ' s trading and pipeline businesses were solid . "" we looked under the hood , and guess what ? it looked just as strong as we thought it was . "" watson said he did not think more damaging disclosures were forthcoming from enron .
until the partnership mess , enron was the nation ' s dominant energy trader , and it had front - door political connections to the white house . lay , its longtime chairman , raised more then $ 100 , 000 for the presidential election campaign of his friend george w . bush . enron rode the growth of energy trading markets beginning in the mid - 1990 s , as first natural gas , and then electric power sales were deregulated at the wholesale level . its revenues leaped from $ 9 . 2 billion in 1995 to $ 100 . 8 billion last year .
during those heady times , the houston company could choose which questions to answer about its dealings with related partnerships and its byzantine bookkeeping .
"" it was always very difficult to get information , "" said louis b . gagliardi , an analyst with john s . herold inc . "" they would always rebuff you . ""
until this fall , the muscular company seemed too big to stumble , said investment manager david coxe , with harris insight equity fund in chicago .
coxe bought 78 , 000 shares of enron at $ 40 a share in august , after wrestling with the decision for months , he said . then jeffrey skilling , enron ' s chief executive and strategic mastermind , unexpectedly resigned . the stock , which had been as high as $ 90 in august 2000 , pitched downward .
"" enron seemed so indispensable to the nation ' s energy markets that i thought it inconceivable it could implode , "" coxe said . "" that ' s how i got sucked in . ""
enron ' s fall is "" classic hubris , "" coxe said : a greek tragedy striking someone who chose to defy the gods - - "" in this case , the rules of the system . ""
among the rules that enron now acknowledges it didn ' t follow were the accounting standards that applied to the complex partnerships it created . the purpose of the partnerships , enron said , was to reduce the risks of investments in internet transmission systems and to sell power plants and other assets it no longer wanted .
the accounting errors were described in a 20 - page sec filing enron made thursday . the errors resulted in a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in the value of shareholders ' equity . the company also said it had overstated its earnings by $ 586 million since 1997 .
enron created partnerships that would buy major assets - - such as a power plant - - that enron wanted to sell , or in other cases , assets such as fiber - optic cable networks that enron intended to run but did not want to have on its balance sheet .
the partnerships had outside investors , but the general partner of two of them was enron ' s own chief financial officer , andrew fastow . he earned $ 30 million in fees from managing two of the largest partnerships , according to the sec document .
enron added to the capital of these partnerships by pledging its stock , or securities convertible into stock . some of those stock transactions should have been counted as loans , resulting in the $ 1 . 2 billion drop in shareholder equity , enron now says .
investors are asking why enron ' s auditor , arthur andersen llp , did not insist that these transactions be handled that way in the first place . enron ' s sec filing mentions but does not explain some "" proposed audit adjustments "" over the past four years that were overruled .
even though , as enron now acknowledges , it created an information barrier , masking critical information and violating standard accounting rules , many financial analysts who were recommending the stock to investors were not pushing hard enough to punch through that barrier , some analysts acknowledge .
"" it was so complicated that everybody was afraid to raise their hands and say , ' i don ' t understand it , ' "" gagliardi said .
the questions are now coming , from a new committee reporting to enron ' s board that will investigate how the company ' s financial reporting was handled ; from the sec ; and , eventually , from teams of lawyers representing aggrieved shareholders .
lay indicated yesterday he had not been aware until recently that enron employees other than fastow had profited from the partnership activity . enron directors had approved fastow ' s management of the partnerships , but fastow quit the partnerships in july and was then replaced as chief financial officer .
enron this week fired treasurer ben glisan and kristina mourdant , an enron division lawyer , who it said had invested in partnerships that were tied to one of the major partnerships headed by fastow . the enron report to the sec describes a central role in these transactions played by michael j . kopper , an associate of fastow who left enron in july to take over fastow ' s financial interests in the partnership , the company said .
enron will hold a conference call next week to discuss what it has uncovered about outside partnership investments .

a year ago , enron corp . chairman kenneth l . lay was on top of the energy world . as a leading fund - raiser , contributor and energy advisor to the bush administration , he played a key role in shaping the new president ' s energy policy . as head of the world ' s largest energy trading company , he had an enormous influence on the price of energy in california and across the nation . enron ' s highflying stock helped him cash out $ 123 million in stock options last year alone .
on friday , with enron being saved from financial collapse by agreeing to be acquired by rival dynegy inc . , lay ' s career and reputation are in shambles . under the merger , he will be stripped of a management job . his integrity is tattered , with enron ' s controversial financial dealings under federal investigation . enron investors and employees are chagrined and outraged because the company ' s stock lost 80 % of its value in recent weeks .
the rapid rise and fall of lay , 58 , is a story of how a brilliant man with innovative ideas and a grand scheme to transform the world ' s energy markets was overcome with arrogance , associates and critics say . under lay , enron stretched the limits of the law and took risks that nearly caused its financial collapse , they say . that in turn could have resulted in a widespread disruption in energy supplies .
"" enron ' s behavior casts doubt on the integrity of our financial markets . it is a very serious matter , "" said edward r . muller , an energy investor and former president of edison international ' s mission energy subsidiary .
"" nobody denies he ' s smart , but it ' s a question of integrity , "" said raymond plank , chief executive of apache corp . and an associate of lay ' s in houston ' s vibrant oil and gas industry .
lay and longtime partner jeffrey k . skilling , who served briefly as enron ' s chief executive before resigning abruptly in august , rose to prominence in the last decade through the use of innovative financial techniques designed to exploit a reduction in government regulation of energy .
lay transformed world energy industries through his vision of new , market - driven ways to finance natural gas and electricity production and transmission .
the financial markets that lay and his enron associates created had an enormous effect on california ' s disastrous experiment in electricity deregulation . critics say his influence was excessive and misguided .
"" ken lay was a mystic , "" said state sen . steve peace ( d - el cajon ) , an outspoken critic of enron . "" whatever he said had to make sense because he was ken lay . it was hero worship . many of the people working as economists at the federal energy regulatory commission worshiped ken lay . as a consequence , the things enron promoted and pushed for were never challenged , intellectually and otherwise . ""
lay , who has a doctorate in economics , had modest beginnings as the son of a poor country preacher who did farm labor on the side to raise money for his children ' s education . in the navy in the late 1960 s , lay was assigned to the defense department because of his economic acumen . "" he allocated pentagon dollars more efficiently in purchasing for the military , "" said mark palmer , chief spokesman for enron .
lay worked for exxon and other energy firms in the 1970 s , amid soaring oil prices , gasoline shortages and still - regulated natural gas . he headed houston natural gas , a predecessor firm of enron , in the 1980 s as falling prices for oil and natural gas presented grave problems for houston ' s energy industries .
when the federal government allowed pipelines to carry the gas of any producer , lay turned enron into a foremost firm in the new , deregulated industry . still , enron almost went bankrupt in the late 1980 s , with natural gas in oversupply and prices falling .

power play / enron had been a political heavyweight / critics decried influence of ken lay in white house

washington - until a few weeks ago , enron corp . was the star of the washington lobbyist corps .
enron chairman ken lay was known to have the ear of his longtime friend and political ally president bush .
vice president dick cheney had unveiled a national energy strategy very much to enron ' s liking , while one of the company ' s favorite electricity regulators , texas ' pat wood iii , had been installed as the new head of the federal energy regulatory commission .
critics feared the houston - based energy and trading giant exerted far too much influence , both in congress and in the bush white house .
now , after the company ' s implosion , enron ' s legendary political might is evaporating as well , political observers say .
"" just a matter of weeks or months ago , enron was still the 800 - pound gorilla , "" said steven weiss , a spokesman for the washington - based center for responsive politics , a political watchdog group . "" it was getting into any meeting it wanted to .
"" relationships are still existent , and bush is unlikely to completely ignore ken lay . but one would have to think the amount of influence that ken lay could exert now pales in comparison to the influence he could have exerted just a month or more ago . ""
now that dynegy has agreed to take over enron , the companies ' role in government will be determined by chuck watson , dynegy ' s chief executive officer .
while enron has been such a player in washington , dynegy is less known inside the capital beltway . but that ' s not to say dynegy has no political pull on capitol hill .
"" ken lay certainly can get meetings with senators , but so can chuck watson , "" a senate staffer said .
while dynegy may be attracted to enron ' s energy trading whiz , the company may be desirous of enron ' s political expertise as well . while watson has had a presence on the national stage , his role in houston ' s stadium votes shows he is hardly allergic to politics .
enron ' s recent troubles , however , may leave a stain . with the securities and exchange commission conducting an investigation into some of the company ' s business dealings , many politicians are likely to be wary .
"" politicians , perhaps better than anyone else , can smell a rotten egg , "" weiss said . "" who would want it reported in the newspaper that they are associated with a company that is under investigation ? ""
enron ' s lobbyist in washington , linda robertson , could not be reached for comment .
a setback among washington ' s elite would be a novel experience for lay and other enron officials . in a city where access is everything , lay has proved - time and again - his political savvy .
a one - time energy policy - maker for richard nixon , lay successfully championed deregulation of the natural gas pipeline industry and has led the effort to open up the electricity markets as well .
a republican , lay served as co - chair of the host committee for the gop ' s national convention in houston in 1992 , when his friend george bush the elder was nominated for a second term . and yet there was lay a few years later , playing golf with the elder bush ' s political nemesis , bill clinton , and advising the democratic administration on energy .
the company has excelled at snatching up political heavyweights as they leave public office . enron has attracted the likes of former secretary of state james baker iii and one - time clinton white house chief of staff thomas "" mack "" mclarty .
enron ' s stable of political lobbyists became a who ' s who of washington insiders , from former christian coalition head ralph reed to one - time energy regulatory commission chairwoman elizabeth "" betsy "" moler .
and by all accounts , enron - and lay especially - rank among the most munificent contributors to george w . bush ' s political career . lay ' s name was mentioned repeatedly as bush drew up his cabinet , and while he did not join the government , he played a role in helping craft bush ' s energy strategy .
lay and other enron officials spent $ 2 . 1 million lobbying congress and the white house last year , the center for responsive politics reported .
in fact , 71 senators and 188 house members have received contributions from lay and other enron officials , the watchdog group found .
questions about lay ' s influence over the federal energy regulatory commission sparked an investigation last summer by congress ' general accounting office .
curt hebert , then the commission chairman , accused lay of trying to prod him into changing his position on an issue of key concern to enron , open access by independent electricity generators to the power lines owned by utilities , in exchange for lay ' s political support .
the gao found no evidence of wrongdoing by either party . three months after the dispute became public , hebert resigned from the commission . he was succeeded by wood , whom enron officials had championed as "" smart , hard - working , fair . ""
just one month ago , enron ' s political muscle appeared undiminished . enron held a conference in washington on energy policy during the first week of october , attracting the likes of wood , senate energy committee chairman jeff bingaman , d - n . m . , and former energy department secretary james schlesinger .
since the start of the company ' s free - fall , enron officials have been less on capitol hill , although that may have merely reflected the city ' s preoccupation with the war on terrorism and the anthrax scare .

power play / sale suddenly switches office outlook downtown

the sale of enron corp . is going to punish houston ' s downtown office market - emptying more office space at a time when several buildings are going up .
enron and its purchaser , dynegy , are both hefty users of downtown office space , and with staff cutbacks likely , they will need a lot less of it .
enron ' s 40 - story office tower , which is under construction on smith street , is expected to be completed next year .
"" if they do go through with the deal , that building is not going to be the enron building . it ' s going to become the dynegy building , "" said office broker sanford criner of the trione & gordon realty firm .
dynegy , which leases 700 , 000 square feet in the wells fargo plaza at 1000 louisiana , would jump at the chance to operate in the new trading floors at the new enron center south , according to a number of downtown office brokers .
"" there ' s no question dynegy has been looking to get a major league trading floor for a long time , "" criner said . "" they definitely covet the enron trading floor . ""
the new 1 . 2 million - square - foot enron tower is a palace of energy trading technology with miles of telecommunications cable running throughout .
the building ' s matching pair of sweeping staircases were intended to lead to the corporate dens of enron chairman ken lay and former ceo jeff skilling but probably will be used by dynegy chairman chuck watson .
john sousa , a spokesman for dynegy , said thursday that the firm ' s current wells fargo space is good and it was too soon to speculate about things like office space .
"" we ' re satisfied with our current location , "" sousa said .
a number of office brokers , however , suggest dynegy would move over to the enron building and attempt to sublease at least some of the space in wells fargo plaza .
enron ' s importance to the houston office market extends beyond the new building . the company occupies about 3 million of the 42 million square feet of office space available downtown , if every small building is counted .
enron occupies its existing 1 . 25 million - square - foot headquarters building at 1400 smith , 500 , 000 square feet of space in three allen center , 60 , 000 square feet in the 500 jefferson building , and 40 , 000 square feet in the 600 jefferson building .
enron has already moved a few employees into its new building , which had been slated to be fully occupied by next summer .
"" this has some real implications , "" said george carpenter of carpenter realty . "" who knows , when the dust settles , where this thing is heading ? ""
trizechahn , which owns the cullen center and allen center properties , had been expecting enron to move out of at least a portion of those buildings when the new enron center south building was complete .
"" we ' re bullish on houston , "" said trizechahn spokesman rick matthews . "" it ' s likely to remain a core market for us . ""
enron ' s shrinkage will come on top of several other moves that will empty downtown office space .
"" it ' s going to be a blood bath next year , "" said one houston office broker who asked that his name not be used .
about 500 , 000 square feet of space will become vacant next year in the chevron tower , according to trione & gordon . a number of chevron employees will be moving into the texaco heritage plaza building as a result of the chevron and texaco merger .
halliburton , another huge downtown office tenant , will be moving out of downtown to new buildings in the westchase area in the next few years , leaving behind a large hole of vacant space at 601 jefferson .
while the demand for office space is beginning to fall , the supply is about to increase .
the 5 houston center , a 27 - story structure that will be complete next year , will open with a significant number of signed tenants . but as major corporate tenants such as ernst & young , jenkens & gilchrist and jackson walker move into the building , they will leave behind vacant space in others .
century development ' s 1000 main building is scheduled to be finished in 2003 . the 783 , 000 - square - foot project , which will have reliant resources as its main tenant , still has more than 200 , 000 square feet of space to lease , according to trione photos : 2 . enron employees kept their cell phones in use outside the company ' s downtown offices friday afternoon . dynegy ' s purchase of enron deals a blow to the city ' s office space market . enron ' s shrinkage will come on top of several other moves that will empty downtown office space ( p . 4 )

baseball history is written fast these days .
as enron corp . , the massive houston energy - trading company , is to be bought out by dynegy , the name enron field may go with it .
enron paid big money - $ 100 million - to put its name on the retractable - roof stadium downtown . it cost a lot to get the name , but it gave enron a lot of marketing firepower and put the company ' s name on the lips of millions of astros fans .
if dynegy completes the acquisition of enron corp . as expected , dynegy also may get the naming rights to the astros ' stadium .
with the name "" enron "" fading in the merger , it appears possible the 42 , 000 - seat baseball stadium would take the dynegy name .
"" if they do something with the company , that name goes with it , "" said pam gardner , president of business operations for the houston astros .
dynegy chairman chuck watson said friday that no decision has been made about renaming the baseball stadium .
however , dynegy did register the domain name dynegyfield . com with verisign , an internet domain name registrar , on thursday .
enron field would not be the first sports facility to undergo a name change .
the compaq center , home of the houston rockets , took the compaq name in 1997 after being called the summit for many years . and the name may be up in the air again as compaq computer corp . contemplates a merger with hewlett - packard .
the stadium for the st . louis rams football team was renamed dome at americas center , after american airlines bought former namesake twa airlines .
"" it ' s not catastrophic if you have to change the name of the arena , "" said dean bonham of bonham group , a sports marketing consulting firm .
sometimes trying to change the name of a stadium can be hard , said kurt hunzeker , editor of team marketing report , a sports business newsletter . the original name for a stadium can be adopted into fan ' s vocabulary , and the secondary names for stadiums don ' t always stick .
many baseball fans in cincinnati have had a hard time adjusting to calling riverfront stadium by its new name of cinergy field , hunzeker said .
sometimes the media refuse to cooperate with the name changes because of tradition or a simple refusal to give into commercialism . the denver post , for example , has refused to adopt the new name of invesco field at mile high stadium .
the deal for a new football stadium for the houston texans is similar to the arrangement with enron field , said steve patterson , senior vice president of the texans .
the texans ' field will be called reliant stadium . if reliant energy is bought out by another company , however , the acquiring company will have the right to change the name of the stadium , patterson said .

executives at royal bank of scotland are among those keeping their fingers crossed that the urgent talks to save the debt - stricken energy trading group enron are successful .
in recent days it has emerged that britain ' s second biggest bank by market capitalisation is a lender to the us group .
at the moment it is not clear how much money the edinburgh bank has lent to enron and whether any of it is secured , but speculation in the market place suggests that the figure could run into millions . it seems rbos was involved in one of the credit facilities arranged for enron , which needs billions of dollars of new money to keep it afloat .
royal bank was yesterday keeping very quiet about the size of the exposure , but worries about the enron situation were enough to push the shares down 44 p to pounds 16 . 70 on a bad day for the banking sector . elsewhere , barclays fell 88 p to pounds 21 . 12 , hsbc lost 9 . 5 p to 792 . 5 p , and lloyds tsb dipped 17 . 5 p to 713 p as investors decided it was time to take some profits .
on the other side of atlantic , enron was locked in talks with rival dynegy over a $ 7 bn ( pounds 4 . 81 bn ) rescue takeover .
with wall street giving up strong gains overnight , as investors decided to book profits after the recent strong run , london ' s top stocks started the day on the back foot . leading shares then trimmed a 50 - point deficit as buyers emerged for heavyweight oil stocks shell , 6 p higher at 514 . 5 p , and bp , 9 p stronger at 565 p after saudi arabia suggested the mood was shifting towards a production cut of 1 . 5 m barrels at next week ' s opec meeting . news that russian oil companies are considering a cut also helped .
that was as good as it got . with wall street failing to provide a lead , the ftse 100 drifted back , eventually closing 33 . 9 points lower at 5 , 244 . 2 . however , dealers were not too downhearted by the performance , pointing to the index ' s 115 - point advance over the week .
cash rich cable & wireless took the ftse 100 ' s wooden spoon , sliding 18 . 25 p to 330 p with dealers attributing its weakness to the re - emergence of talk that it is poised to make a big acquisition . opinion was divided over the potential target . most dealers plumped for colt telecom , which has been linked with c & w in recent weeks . sure enough the shares responded , ending the day 10 . 5 p better at 158 p .
others reckoned c & w had its eye on energis and had approached 30 % shareholder national grid with a view to buying its stake . whatever the truth of that rumour , analysts think energis would be a better bolt - on acquisition for c & w than colt . energis shares eased a penny to 89 p .
invensys , the industrial controls group , firmed 4 . 25 p to 78 . 75 p on hopes that a positive outlook statement will accompany thursday ' s interim results . the figures will also provide analysts with their first chance to quiz new chief executive rick haythornthwaite on his plans to turn around the heavily indebted company .
among the mid caps , carphone warehouse underperformed , falling 2 . 5 p to 109 p , as worries resurfaced about the demand for mobile phones in the christmas trading period .
joint broker csfb caused the trouble . with the outlook uncertain csfb said it had taken the precaution of lowering its pretax profits forecast to a "" worst case scenario "" pounds 55 m . its previous estimate was pounds 67 . 3 m . csfb tried play down the significance of the downgrade , arguing that carphone was likely to outperform its rivals in the next month , but many traders interpreted it as an attempt to lower the city ' s expectations .
furniture group mfi was heading in the other direction , improving 10 . 5 p to 130 p after house broker deutsche bank raised hopes that wednesday ' s trading update could impress . the german investment bank believes business has been good at mfi in recent months and the company is on course to meet its pretax profit forecast of pounds 63 . 5 m .
in an otherwise dull tech sector , autonomy , the intelligent software group advanced 14 . 75 p to 313 p . traders heard talk that the company had secured a couple of big contracts that were put on hold after september ' s terrorist attacks .
there was also a flurry of interest in debenhams , the department store group , on speculation that the company will be tipped in a weekend newspaper . the shares finished 23 p higher at 395 p .
in the smaller companies world , retail investors were chasing redbus interhouse , the web - hosting company run by john porter , the multi - millionaire tesco heir and son of dame shirley porter .
dealers said the investors were betting that monday ' s third quarter figures would top expectations . given the over capacity in the web - hosting market and the fact redbus admitted with interim results in september that demand had fallen , most traders took the view that this was a bold and potentially foolhardy gamble .
elsewhere , those retail investors suckered into character group , the toy and games maker , when its shares hit 30 p late on thursday were nursing losses .
before the market opened , the company said that while one of its division produced a range of harry potter gift products it was not an official potter licensee . character , which had almost doubled in the previous session , shed 6 . 75 p to 24 . 25 p .
there was also some pain for shareholders of brammer , the industrial services group , which fell 61 . 5 p to 256 p after warning full - year pretax profits would be 25 % lower than last year .
engineering group senior gained 0 . 25 p to 29 . 5 p after a stock overhang was cleared . traders believe the shares could enjoy a good run next week , especially as bid rumours are floating around .

enron , the troubled us energy company with close ties to president bush , was yesterday bought for $ 9 . 5 billion ( pounds 6 . 5 billion ) by its smaller rival dynegy .
the move brings to a close one of the most spectacular wall street downfalls of recent years . shareholders in enron , who have seen more than $ 60 billion wiped off the value of the company this year , will get about 0 . 27 of a dynegy share for every share they own in enron , valuing the deal at $ 10 . 41 per enron share .
the deal comes amid a securities & exchange commission investigation into enron ' s controversial business practices . the struggling company also admitted on thursday that it had overstated its profits by nearly $ 586 million and understated its debt by $ 2 . 6 billion over the past four years .
as part of the deal , chevrontexaco , which owns 27 per cent of dynegy , will invest $ 2 . 5 billion in the merged company . shares of dynegy gained $ 2 . 26 to close at $ 38 . 76 . enron shares rose 22 cents to $ 8 . 63 . the announcement on the merger of the two houston - based companies came after the us markets closed .
before the deal was announced , enron saw its credit rating cut by moody ' s to a notch above "" junk "" status . meanwhile , enron ' s exit from a $ 2 . 9 billion power plant project in india was blocked by the bombay high court .
fears also heightened yesterday that us energy traders were beginning to bypass enron ' s internet - based energy trading systems because of concern over the company ' s ability to settle transactions and pay back collateral . so far , enron ' s trading operations have remained immune from the disasters to hit the company on wall street .
the past few weeks have seen the departure of enron ' s finance director , andrew fastow , and its treasurer , ben glisan . the company ' s chief executive , jeffrey skilling , resigned in august .
however , some analysts expressed scepticism at the merger . carole coale , an analyst with prudential securities , said she was puzzled as to "" why dynegy ' s management would want to take on the uncertainties and potential liabilities associated with a merger with enron "" .
enron is america ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and one of the country ' s ten largest companies with revenues last year of more than $ 100 billion .

us regulators are investigating off - balance sheet deals allegedly struck by former finance director andrew fastow , who has since left the company .
enron ' s managing director and chief counsel were sacked earlier this week for their roles in the affair . enron took a 685 m charge , prompting a 90 pc fall in its share price . this week , it restated four - year profits down by 22 pc to 405 m .

dynegy to get prime downtown real estate in enron deal

houston ( ap ) - enron corp . chairman kenneth lay envisioned the four trading floors within his company ' s newly constructed silver glass tower - that was to be its new world headquarters - as an energy trading center much like the chicago mercantile exchange .
"" they are pretty spectacular , "" enron spokeswoman karen denne said of the trading floors following the announcement of dynegy inc . ' s plans to buy enron for about $ 8 billion in stock late friday . "" it is a huge state - of - the - art trading floor . they are really neat . ""
but the trading platforms likely won ' t be enron ' s for long .
if the proposed deal between the two houston - based energy trading companies is approved , the $ 200 million , 40 - story building will be among dynegy ' s new assets in the purchase of its much larger rival . the ornate building , complete with metal sunshades and fins that deflect the sun and lower energy costs , is scheduled for completion sometime next summer .
"" the last three weeks haven ' t been a whole lot of fun , "" lay said during a press conference about the merger friday at dynegy ' s headquarters just a few blocks away from where an oval shaped skybridge encircles smith street .
the enclosed , air conditioned bridge connects what was to be enron ' s new headquarters with its current building on the opposite side of the street .
enron had long - term plans to complete its urban campus with a third tower after building a second tower in 1999 , the first major office building project in downtown houston in more than a decade .
lay and his former chief executive officer , jeff skilling , were to have seventh - floor offices overlooking the trading floors . two curved grand stairways connect the offices to the floors below .
but enron ' s future started changing shortly after skilling ' s surprise resignation in august .
last month enron reported major losses in third quarter earnings . the company ' s stock then tumbled 80 percent in the past three weeks as investors grew increasingly concerned that serious financial problems were being hidden from shareholders through business partnerships now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission .
a day after lay expressed his confidence in his chief financial officer andrew fastow , who managed those partnerships , fastow was ousted in an attempt to regain investor confidence .
it didn ' t work , and skilling has since been called to testify before the sec about the partnerships .
then dynegy stepped in , and one houston company came to the rescue of another , prudential securities inc . analyst carol coale said .
"" enron needed dynegy . they needed a rescuer , "" coale said . "" the run on enron stock was similar to a run on a bank . once things start to capitulate it can run right down into liquidity . ""
while dynegy says its too early to discuss layoffs , what happens to the name of the houston astros ' enron field or the future uses for enron ' s buildings , university of houston economist barton smith doubted the company will let the prime real estate go unused .
"" at one time ken lay and his family had a vision of houston having an energy exchange and i think that vision is going to continue , "" smith said . "" this brings dynegy , which was a relatively small player , in as a pretty strong force . ""
smith said reductions in philanthropic giving are likely . enron has contributed to many texas schools , including the university of houston , rice university , the university of texas and southern methodist university .
while the company ' s philanthropy has gained fans in texas , many in california , plagued by power shortages earlier this year , still resent enron for its outspoken support of deregulation .
"" the principles of karma seem to be working here , "" said harvey rosenfield , founder of a california consumer advocacy group . "" here enron was one of the chief proponents of deregulation and took advantage of it and benefitted enormously and now is reaping the consequences . ""
texas economists say ripple effects of the dynegy - enron merger on houston ' s economy will be minimal , even if the combination forces layoffs .
"" there are some recessionary pressures going on in the united states , but houston is probably in a better position than any city i know of to dampen those pressures , "" said mark baxter , director of the maguire energy institute at southern methodist university . "" the houston market is unique in that aspect . ""
but michelle michot foss , director of the energy institute at the university of houston , said the nation ' s fourth - largest city isn ' t immune to a weakening national economy .
"" we do have a three - pronged problem in town , which is continental , compaq and enron , "" she said . "" but there is no way this is as bad as ( the oil bust years of ) 1986 and 1987 . ""
houston - based continental airlines has cut 12 , 000 jobs and reduced its flight schedule in the wake of sept . 11 ' s attacks in new york , washington d . c . and pennsylvania . meanwhile , hewlett - packard is attempting to buy compaq , also based in houston , which could result in additional layoffs from the computer maker .
"" the whole debacle with enron has been very unfortunate , "" smith said . "" enron , in some ways , was the icon of houston with the merger of compaq . now it looks as if it ' s going to be dynegy . ""

enron india pwr unit sale faces review after dynegy deal

( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones tata power co . ltd . ( p . tpw ) and bses ltd . ( p . bsx ) - heavyweights in the indian power sector .
enron wants to sell its controlling equity stake in the $ 2 . 9 billion project due to payment defaults by the plant ' s sole customer - the maharashtra state electricity board - and the indian federal government ' s failure to honor payment guarantees .
a bombay - based analyst with a leading indian brokerage agreed that the issues surrounding the sale of enron ' s stake in the dpc would have to reevaluated "" from scratch . ""
"" some post - takeover ' cleaning - up ' in the merged entity will be expected . dynegy really need to see what their energy interests are and whether india will figure in them , "" the analyst said .
the analyst doubted dynegy would take over enron ' s stake in the dpc itself in an attempt to revive it . "" prima facie , it appears unlikely . it ( dynegy ) has not really got into independent power projects outside the u . s . , "" the analyst said .
indian media reports over the past two months have said enron wants $ 1 billion for its stake in dabhol .
however , commentators say enron may have to sell at a discount given the company ' s deepening financial woes . a discounted sale would remain the case for dynegy "" without a doubt "" post - takeover , the analyst said .
dpc officials were unavailable for comment at the time of writing .
indian banking executives remained tight - lipped on the outcome of the singapore talks , but described negotiations as "" very fruitful "" and "" successful . ""
"" there was full cooperation from all sides . certainly , we have moved forward , but there ' s no decision ( on a buyer for enron ' s stake ) as yet , "" said idbi executive director a . k . doda . "" i ' m hopeful if we go through these routes it ' ll lead somewhere . ""
the idbi ' s vora said all concerned parties had "" no immediate "" plans to hold any further talks .
asked whether tata power was the frontrunner , as many analysts believe , doda said : "" that ' s their guess . ""
analysts said tata power and bses wouldn ' t necessarily be out of the running after the dynegy - enron merger . "" i think dynegy will be relatively more willing to diversify dpc and that wouldn ' t change the equation vis - a - vis tata and bses , "" he said . "" overall , it ' s positive . ""
dabhol is india ' s largest single foreign investment . mseb holds a 15 % stake , while general electric co . ( ge ) and bechtel ( x . btl ) own 10 % each .
dpc ' s domestic lenders include icici ltd . ( p . icc ) , industrial development bank of india ( p . idb ) , ifci ltd . ( p . ici ) and state bank of india ( p . sbi ) .
loans by foreign lenders , including abn amro , bank of america corp . and citigroup inc . , however , are backed by government guarantees , while domestic lenders ' loans are not .

singapore ( ap ) - talks in singapore to assess possible buyers for u . s . - based enron corp . ' s controlling stake in the troubled indian dabhol power company have been extended into an unscheduled third day , an indian banking executive involved in the negotiations said saturday .
the two - day closed - door meeting - originally scheduled to wrap up friday - is focusing on two potential buyers of houston - based enron ' s 65 percent stake in the power company .
tata power co . and bses ltd . - two of india ' s largest private power companies - are the only contenders vying to buy enron ' s stake in dabhol .
"" talks will carry on today ( saturday ) , "" said a . k . doda , executive director of the industrial development bank of india . "" it ' s going to take a little more time . ""
senior indian banking sources told dow jones newswire that the talks are "" intense , "" but "" positive , "" with negotiations continuing past midnight local time .
dabhol managing director k . wade cline , officials from both prospective buyers and a consortium of indian lenders to the dabhol project are involved in the talks .
the dabhol power company owns a 2 , 184 megawatt power plant in the western indian state of maharashtra . the company is embroiled in a bitter power supply dispute with the state government over allegedly "" unaffordable "" power tariffs .
enron wants to sell its controlling equity stake in the dlrs 2 . 9 billion project due to payment defaults by the plant ' s sole customer - the maharashtra state electricity board - and the indian federal government ' s failure to honor payment guarantees .
dabhol is india ' s biggest - ever single foreign investment . the maharashtra state electricity board holds a 15 percent stake , while general electric co . and bechtel group inc . own 10 percent each .
domestic lenders have provided dlrs 1 . 4 billion of the project ' s total projected cost of dlrs 2 . 9 billion .
loans by foreign lenders , including abn amro , bank of america corp . and citigroup inc . are backed by government guarantees .

all eyes in electric industry on texas as deregulation nears
by david koenig
ap business writer
11 / 10 / 2001
associated press newswires
copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved .
dallas ( ap ) - electric deregulation was a fabulous failure in california , resulting in skyrocketing rates , accusations of price - gouging and fears of widespread power blackouts .
the flop has made consumers elsewhere suspicious about giving up their regulated monopoly utilities for competition among power companies .
regulators and industry officials are turning their attention to texas , where deregulation is scheduled to begin jan . 1 after a rocky test program .
"" people are looking to texas as the next iteration of retail competition . a lot of states have pulled back after the california experience , "" says brett perlman , a member of the public utility commission . "" if texas is successful , texas will become the model for the nation . ""
ken malloy , president of a pro - deregulation think tank called the center for the advancement of energy markets , called texas the state to watch .
"" california obviously created a domino effect , "" leading other states to delay deregulation , malloy said . "" a lot of people are placing a lot of hope on texas . ""
texas officials say that unlike california , which must import much of its power , texas imports little and has built more than 50 new power plants since 1995 , providing an important cushion .
texas also made it easier for power generators and resellers to negotiate long - term contracts , which officials say will help lock in lower prices . and texas provides more - digestible price information , making it easier for consumers to comparison - shop , they say .
california officials warn that texans may be a little too smug .
they spot trouble already in texas , including california - style price spikes in some spot markets for electricity - a clear sign , they say , that power companies are learning how to maximize profits by forcing prices up .
"" there are things that can be done by people who own the power to create a shortage , and if they see an opportunity to make money doing that they will , "" said john rozsa , an aide to state sen . steve peace , who was heavily involved in california ' s deregulation debate .
california officials accuse the power companies - many of them texas - based - of withholding supplies or clogging transmission lines to drive prices higher . they say the same techniques could be used in texas .
supporters and opponents of deregulation do agree that the stakes will be high in texas for power companies and consumers .
"" if the wheels fall off , it would be hard to put it back together , "" says bob manning , an executive with san antonio - based h - e - b grocery co . , which hopes to cut its $ 40 million annual electricity bill through deregulation by at least 6 percent .
the idea behind electric deregulation is simple and powerful . instead of forcing residents and businesses to buy their power from a monopoly such as txu electric or reliant , let them choose among several competing companies .
in theory , competition should cause prices to fall , as it did for air travel and long - distance phone service . that ' s what the texas legislature thought when it voted in 1999 to let utility customers pick a new power company beginning jan . 1 , 2002 .
power traders led by enron corp . lobbied heavily for deregulation , figuring they could profit by gaining a chunk of the utilities ' business even though enron produces little power itself .
to prepare for deregulation , the legislature approved a seven - month pilot program in which a few commercial and residential customers would be able to switch . soon , glaring problems emerged .
the trial program was delayed three times . when it finally began this summer , the state ' s main power grid struggled to switch customers to their new power company . prices for backup power used on hot summer days temporarily jumped 100 - fold .
through it all , the public utility commission and the power companies and their allies have insisted the pilot program was serving its purpose of highlighting potential problems .
"" anytime you buy a new home there are a whole bunch of things you need to get fixed before you move in , "" perlman said this week . "" we ' re going down that punch list , and i think we ' ll be ready on jan . 1 . ""
the unresolved issues , he said , include how utilities such as txu and reliant will pass on the cost of fuel to their customers , who were guaranteed a 6 percent rate cut on jan . 1 .
in addition to the technical setbacks , deregulation suffered a blow when shell energy , a unit of the anglo - dutch energy giant , pulled out of texas after signing up 40 , 000 customers . suddenly one of the biggest players and a potent competitor to txu and reliant had vanished .
shell has said that doing business in texas became uneconomical after other states delayed deregulation .
"" that was a bit bizarre , because they had spent a lot of money to attract customers , "" said brian lloyd , a top puc official on pricing issues . "" but if they don ' t want to be here , we don ' t want them . ""
lloyd and other puc officials are confident that as deregulation catches on , other power companies will move in to texas , ensuring strong competition .
already , however , deregulation will be delayed beyond jan . 1 because of a lack of competition and questions about power - transmission in a section of southeast texas served by entergy corp . and in a stretch of northeast texas served by southwestern electric power co .
last month , consumers union , aarp and other groups asked the puc to delay competition everywhere in texas because of computer glitches and billing problems during the pilot program .
deregulation advocates worry that residential customers will simply stay with their old electric utility , causing new competitors to fail .
the puc is likely to push ahead after receiving a final round of comments next week from electric companies and officials of the main power grid , called the electric reliability council of texas , or ercot .
along with the power traders , large commercial customers - like the h - e - b grocery chain - figure to be winners .
"" a grocery store is an energy hog , "" manning said . "" we have a lot of refrigerators that run 24 hours a day , 365 days a year . we help ( the power companies ' ) bottom line . ""
perlman , the puc member , predicted deregulation will start on time but said that making it trouble - free was the most important goal to build consumer confidence .
"" a year from now , no one will remember whether the market opened on jan . 1 or jan . 15 or march 15 , "" he said .

enron says it ' s too soon to quantify u . k . job cuts ( updatel )
2001 - 11 - 10 07 : 24 ( new york )
enron says it ' s too soon to quantify u . k . job cuts ( updatel )
( adds detail on u . k . operations , dynegy transaction , lenders ,
from fifth paragraph . )
london , nov . 10 ( bloomberg ) - - dynegy inc . ' s $ 23 billion
acquisition of enron corp . is at too early a stage for either
company to know how many u . k . jobs will be eliminated , an enron
spokesman said , after a newspaper reported 4 , 000 are at risk .
dynegy ' s acquisition of the biggest energy trader , announced
yesterday , ` ` is still a long way off from closing , ' ' said enron
spokesman alex parsons . ` ` it ' s too early to know what the impact
will be on u . k . jobs , ' ' he said .
the daily mail newspaper , which didn ' t cite sources , said
today that 4 , 000 jobs are at risk , mainly at enron ' s wessex water
unit , in southwest england , two power plants on teeside , in
northeast england , and at its energy trading operation . it employs
5 , 400 people in europe , mostly in the u . k . , said parsons .
dynegy said yesterday it would save as much as $ 500 million a
year by ` ` winding down ' ' enron ' s business outside of trading and
pipelines and cutting costs .
enron decided to sell after its shares plunged 90 percent
this year amid investors ' concerns about the accuracy of its
financial statements . the company had said in october it planned
to eliminate as many as 500 jobs in europe , or almost as much as
10 percent of the workforce there , to reduce costs .
offset risk
the company , which owns generation in the u . k . to offset risk
in its power trading operations , said in august two workers died
and two others were seriously injured in an explosion and fire at
teeside power station , which it operates and partly owns .
enron owns wessex water as part of its azurix water unit . it
spent $ 2 . 8 billion in 1998 for wessex , from which azurix emerged .
enron sold azurix shares to the public in 1999 , and then bought
back the company this year after the unit failed in its strategy
of buying up water companies and winning large projects .
in august , enron agreed to sell azurix ' s north american
business to american water works inc . for $ 150 million .
the dynegy transaction is expected to close in 2002 ' s third
quarter . the new company will have $ 90 billion in assets , dynegy
said . dynegy ' s stockholders , including chevrontexaco , will have 64
percent of the new company . enron ' s holders will own the rest .
the merger will face opposition from consumer groups ,
especially in california , where energy traders such as dynegy and
enron were blamed for soaring electricity prices that left the
state ' s biggest utility bankrupt and the second - largest fighting
for a government bailout .
other companies may yet be caught in the fallout from enron ' s
situation . royal bank of scotland group plc is a lender to enron ,
the guardian newspaper reported today , without citing sources .
it ' s unclear how much the u . k . ' s no . 3 bank by assets lent
enron , though it may be as high as several million pounds , the
paper said . it ' s not clear if the loans are secured , it said .
royal bank was involved in setting up a credit facility for enron ,
the newspaper said , adding this helped push down the company ' s
share price by 2 . 6 percent yesterday .

dynegy to buy enron for $ 23 billion in stock , debt ( update 9 )
2001 - 11 - 09 23 : 23 ( new york )
dynegy to buy enron for $ 23 billion in stock , debt ( update 9 )
( adds advisers in last paragraph . )
houston , nov . 9 ( bloomberg ) - - dynegy inc . agreed to buy
enron corp . for at least $ 23 billion in stock and assumed debt ,
ending a financial crisis that threatened to bankrupt enron and
disrupt u . s . power and natural - gas markets .
investors will get 0 . 2685 of a dynegy share for each enron
share , or $ 10 . 41 based on dynegy ' s closing price today . the stock
portion of the transaction is valued at $ 8 billion to $ 9 billion ,
dynegy chief financial officer robert doty said . dynegy said it
will assume about $ 15 billion in enron debt .
enron , the largest energy trader , decided to sell after its
shares plunged 90 percent this year and a federal investigation of
accounting irregularities limited its ability to finance
operations . enron ' s collapse would have caused upheaval in energy
markets , where the company does one - quarter of all gas and power
trades , traders say .
` ` without someone stepping in to play the role enron plays ,
people ( would ) have a difficult time executing transactions , ' '
said daniel gordon , president of allegheny energy inc . ' s trading
unit .
chevrontexaco corp . , the second - biggest u . s . oil company and
owner of 26 percent of dynegy , will provide enron with
$ 1 . 5 billion immediately . chevrontexaco will give dynegy
$ 1 billion after the merger closes .
dynegy chief executive officer charles watson , who led a
company that has put as much emphasis on building power plants as
on energy trading , will take over a larger rival that chairman and
ceo kenneth lay had focused on trading .
earnings reduced
lay ' s strategy boosted enron ' s reported revenue to
$ 100 . 7 billion in 2000 , almost four times dynegy ' s and more than
20 times what enron generated in 1995 . at its peak in december
2000 , enron stock was valued at more than $ 69 billion .
in recent months , enron shares plummeted as investors began
to question the accuracy of enron ' s financial statements , saying
it was unclear whether the company was using affiliated
partnerships to move debt off its books and hide losses .
yesterday the company restated its earnings for the past
four years , lowering them by more than $ 500 million to include
losses from partnerships it once kept off its books . after the
merger announcement , standard & poor ' s investors service said it
may lower dynegy ' s debt rating . it cut enron ' s to ` ` bbb - , ' ' one
notch above junk .
watson , dynegy president stephen bergstrom and cfo doty will
keep their positions at the combined company . greg whalley , the
president and chief operating officer of enron , will be an
executive vice president . lay said he won ' t be an active manager
in the new company . lay has not discussed a severance package with
him , watson said .
$ 200 billion in revenue
dynegy said it will have annual revenue of more than
$ 200 billion , more than 22 , 000 megawatts of electric generating
capacity and 25 , 000 miles of pipeline after the merger . the
company will save as much as $ 500 million a year by ` ` winding
down ' ' enron ' s business outside of trading and pipelines and
cutting costs , dynegy said .
the announcement of the merger came after the close of stock
market trading , though the two companies had acknowledged they
were in talks . shares of dynegy rose $ 2 . 26 , or 6 percent , to
$ 38 . 76 . enron rose 22 cents to $ 8 . 63 . chevrontexaco rose $ 1 . 90 to
$ 89 . 49 . enron ' s 6 . 4 percent bonds , which mature in 2006 , jumped
to about 76 cents on the dollar , up from 69 cents , traders said .
the combination is expected to be ` ` strongly accretive ' ' to
earnings , dynegy said . it projected earnings of $ 3 . 40 to $ 3 . 50 a
share next year . it had been expected to earn $ 2 . 57 , the average
estimate of analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call .
third quarter closing
the transaction is expected to close in 2002 ' s third quarter .
the new company will have $ 90 billion in assets , dynegy said .
dynegy ' s stockholders , including chevrontexaco , will have 64
percent of the new company . enron ' s holders will own the rest .
` ` dynegy is taking out a competitor , acquiring some attractive
assets and they ' re doing it at an incredible price , ' ' said joseph
correnti , an analyst at wayne hummer investments who doesn ' t own
shares of either company . enron will pay a
$ 350 million breakup fee if the transaction collapses .
the two houston - based companies began negotiations a week ago
as it became apparent that enron needed cash to stay in business .
watson said he approached lay .
` ` i simply called ken to see if there was anything we could
do to straighten ' ' out rumors of a cash crunch at enron , watson
said . ` ` that next saturday , ken was gracious enough to invite me
over to his home . ' '
dynegy agreed to the terms after moody ' s investors service
maintained an investment grade rating on enron today , eliminating
a stumbling block in negotiations .
cash crunch
moody ' s announcement removed the threat that a junk rating
would force enron to repay early $ 3 . 3 billion in bonds . enron has
been battling a cash crunch and a loss of investor confidence
because of questions about partnerships started by its senior
executives .
enron fired chief financial officer andrew fastow in october
as a securities and exchange commission investigation focused in
on partnerships he headed and helped create . enron estimated
fastow made $ 30 million through partnerships affiliated with the
company .
the sec began the investigation after enron reduced third -
quarter earnings by more than $ 1 billion and said dealings with
two partnerships had lowered shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion .
` ` clearly , ( the partnerships ) created quite a perception
problem for the company , and maybe more serious problems than
that , ' ' lay said on a conference call after the buyout
announcement . ` ` we ' ll see over time . ' '
california opposition
the merger will face opposition from consumer groups ,
especially in california , where energy traders such as dynegy and
enron were blamed for soaring electricity prices that left the
state ' s biggest utility bankrupt and the second - largest fighting
for a government bailout .
` ` we will petition the state attorney general and federal
authorities to block this merger , ' ' said doug heller of the
california - based foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights .
` ` this would further tighten the grip that the unregulated power
industry has over california , and it ' s the grip of the energy
cartel that has choked california for the last year and a half . ' '
energy trading markets ` ` are relatively fragmented ' ' so there
should be no antitrust problems , even though enron and dynegy are
big companies , said robert burka , a washington - based antitrust
attorney with foley & lardner . ` ` enron may well not be a healthy
company going forward ' ' if the merger isn ' t approved , burka said .
enrononline
the combination of the two companies will leave watson with
control of enrononline , an internet energy and commodities trading
site that has done more than $ 880 billion in trades since it was
created in november 1999 .
` ` it ' s not perfectly capturing the value of enron , but if
you ' re on the board at enron at this point , you take it and move
on , ' ' said correnti of wayne hummer investments .
the total value of the stock portion of the transaction
could rise , depending how many enron shares need to be converted
in the stock swap . an enron spokesman said the company had 913
million shares on a fully diluted basis , though a person familiar
with the talks said enron ' s stock price is so low that many common
share equivalents won ' t be converted , leaving the number at 743
million shares .
lehman brothers inc . is dynegy ' s financial adviser on the
transaction . salomon smith barney inc . and j . p . morgan & co . are
advising enron .

dynegy announces $ 8 billion deal to buy larger rival enron
by juan a . lozano

houston ( ap ) - energy marketer dynegy inc . announced friday that it will buy its much larger rival , the once mighty but now troubled enron corp . , for $ 8 billion in stock . dynegy also will assume a hefty $ 15 billion in enron debt .
the announcement came after enron ' s stock price plummeted about 80 percent over the past three weeks because of concerns that the company wasn ' t revealing serious financial problems to shareholders .
under the deal , chevrontexaco corp . , which owns more than a quarter of dynegy , would quickly provide about $ 1 . 5 billion . chevrontexaco also would contribute an additional $ 1 billion upon completion of the deal , the companies said .
"" with its market - making capabilities , earnings power and proven strategic approach to wholesale markets , enron is the ideal strategic partner for dynegy , "" dynegy chairman and chief executive officer chuck watson said in announcing the purchase .
watson made it clear that he would not tolerate the sort of financial practices that prompted explosive disclosures by enron this week - including an admission that more than half a billion dollars in debt had been kept off the company ' s books .
"" as a combined company , we will focus on leveraging our core skill sets and , as always , we will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key priorities , "" watson said .
enron is the country ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas , and the no . 1 wholesale power marketer . the company operates a 25 , 000 - mile gas pipeline system , and also markets and trades metals , paper , coal , chemicals , and fiber - optic bandwidth .
dynegy controls nearly 15 , 000 megawatts of power generating capacity through investments in power projects , and sells the energy in wholesale markets and through utilities .
at a news conference , watson said company officials who negotiated the deal came away convinced that enron was worth buying despite its recent troubles .
"" we looked under the hood and , guess what , it ' s just as strong as we thought it was , "" watson said .
under the terms of the deal , enron shareholders will receive . 2685 dynegy share for each share of enron common stock , valuing each enron share at $ 10 . 41 . enron has about 775 million common shares , said spokeswoman karen denne .
that represents a 21 percent premium above enron ' s closing price of $ 8 . 63 friday on the new york stock exchange - but still just a fraction of their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 87 . dynegy ' s shares climbed $ 2 . 26 , or 6 percent , to close at $ 38 . 76 on the nyse .
in after hours trading on the nyse , enron shares shot up 15 . 6 percent , or $ 1 . 35 , to $ 9 . 98 . dynegy shares were unchanged .
dynegy ' s stockholders will own approximately 64 percent of the new company , with enron ' s stockholders holding the remainder .
the boards of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction , which is expected to close next summer . the deal is expected to save the combined company between $ 400 and $ 500 million annually because of continued elimination of "" non - core "" enron holdings and lower operating costs . watson said it was too soon to say if the deal would result in job cuts . enron has about 20 , 000 employees , while dynegy ' s work force is about 6 , 000 .
watson will remain as chairman and chief executive of the combined company , which will retain the dynegy inc . name . dynegy ' s steve bergstrom will continue as president .
enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay will no longer have a role in day - to - day management of the company , but has been offered a seat on the combined company ' s board and will help shepherd the merger through .
dynegy said that greg whalley , the current president and chief operating officer of enron , will become an executive vice president of the new dynegy . he said the merger sets the best course for enron .
"" few of the options we considered for our core business going forward provided us with the earning potential and immediate synergies that a merger with dynegy could deliver , "" whalley said . "" together with enron ' s recently announced bank commitments , this cash infusion gives enron immediate liquidity , which we believe will enable the company to maintain its investment grade credit rating . ""
the merger was announced a day after enron acknowledged it overstated earnings by about 20 percent over the past four years and kept large amounts of debt off its balance sheets through business partnerships now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission .
analysts said the merger rescues enron , but leaves dynegy in uncharted territory - with the outcome of the sec investigation completely unknown . "" there is still a shroud hanging over enron that now moves over to dynegy , "" said carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities .
early friday , moody ' s investors service downgraded enron ' s debt ratings to one level above junk bond status and said the company ' s long - term debt ratings remain under review for further downgrade .
in an sec filing , enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 "" should not be relied upon "" and that outside businesses run by enron officials during that period should have been included in the company ' s earnings reports .
the revised statements reduced enron ' s profits for those years by $ 586 million , from $ 2 . 89 billion to $ 2 . 31 billion . the revisions also increased the company ' s debt each of the four years , reaching $ 10 . 86 billion - $ 628 million more than previously reported - by the end of 2000 .
keeping the debt off its balance sheets likely ensured enron could maintain a strong credit rating to support expansion of its core businesses - wholesale trading of natural gas and electricity .
but the company ' s stock price started dropping 10 months ago when its high - speed internet unit foundered and enron had trouble collecting money from power customers in india .
the stock price began to free fall after enron announced a $ 618 million third quarter loss , and news of the sec investigation surfaced .
enron responded by firing its chief financial officer and scrambled to get cash and increase credit lines in an attempt to regain investor confidence , but investors dumped enron shares and sent its stock plummeting .
the ousted chief financial officer , andrew fastow , ran some of the partnerships under investigation by the sec .
jeff skilling , enron ' s former chief executive who left in august , has been called to testify before the sec , although it ' s unclear when .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
( adds new material from news conference , new analyst comments )
by andrew kelly
houston , nov . 9 ( reuters ) - dynegy inc . agreed on friday to acquire rival enron corp . for some $ 9 billion in stock , underlining the dramatic reversal of fortunes for the houston - based energy trading giant that was valued last year at nearly $ 80 billion .
enron ' s stock fell sharply in the past month due to investors ' concerns about murky transactions that sparked an investigation by u . s . regulators and damaging downgrades by credit rating agencies .
"" it ' s an unbelievable ending to an unbelievable story , "" said fulcrum global partners analyst michael barbis . "" the company that created the industry is gone - it ' s all dynegy now . ""
the merged company will retain the dynegy name . it will have annual revenues of more than $ 200 billion and assets worth $ 90 billion , including more than 22 , 000 megawatts of electricity generating capacity and 25 , 000 miles of natural gas pipelines .
it will be north america ' s biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity , positions previously held by enron .
dynegy will control the new 14 - member board , holding 11 of its seats , and the top executive positions .
chevrontexaco corp . , a 26 . 5 percent stakeholder in dynegy , will provide an immediate infusion of $ 1 . 5 billion to keep enron ' s core trading operations afloat and a further $ 1 billion when the deal closes . it will get three board seats .
dynegy ' s watson firmly in control
the deal puts chuck watson , dynegy ' s pioneering chairman and chief executive who has long labored under enron ' s shadow , firmly in charge of the new company .
"" it is a great deal for dynegy and , under the circumstances , as a good of a deal as enron could get , "" said ubs warburg analyst ron barone .
watson will remain chairman and chief executive of the merged company , while dynegy ' s president , steve bergstrom , and chief financial officer , rob doty , will retain those positions .
greg whalley , president and chief operating officer of enron , will become an executive vice president and will join watson , bergstrom and doty in the office of the chairman .
barbis said that after enron saw its stock fall 75 percent over the last month , cutting its market capitalization by $ 19 billion , the company was left in a weak negotiating position . "" at the end of the day they had no choice , "" he said .
dynegy will swap 0 . 2685 shares of its own stock for each enron share , valuing houston - based enron at $ 10 . 41 per share , a premium of 21 percent over friday ' s closing price of $ 8 . 63 .
the price is far below a lofty high of $ 90 . 56 set on aug . 23 , 2000 , when enron was riding a wave of investor enthusiasm .
dynegy stockholders will own about 64 percent and enron stockholders will own about 36 percent of the merged company .
regulators probe enron deals
enron had been struggling to overcome a plummeting stock price and credit ratings in the past month following disclosures of off - balance sheet deals now under investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission .
enron chairman and chief executive ken lay told a news conference in houston that he would have preferred enron to retain its independence but that this had become impossible in the face of a "" consistent barrage of really negative articles "" .
"" the last three weeks haven ' t been a whole lot of fun , "" said lay , adding that he had not yet decided whether to take up watson ' s offer of a seat on the merged company ' s board .
watson said the agreement with enron includes "" escape clauses "" that would allow dynegy to back out of the deal if any further undisclosed problems were to emerge , but he said he was confident that this would not happen .
"" you know , we looked under the hood and guess what ? it ' s just as strong as we though it was , "" he said .
watson said he did not expect the merger to run into serious regulatory obstacles .
"" regulatory agencies realize that a speedy resolution is important to keep stability in the u . s . energy market . this has got to be resolved , "" said ubs warburg analyst barone .
dynegy said it expects the new company to earn $ 3 . 40 to $ 3 . 50 per share in 2002 , an increase of 35 percent , or 90 cents to 95 cents per share , for current dynegy shareholders , before taking into account expected synergies and cost savings .
dynegy estimates annual pretax savings of $ 400 million to $ 500 million as a result of the sale or winding down of non - core businesses in the enron portfolio and other measures .
watson said he did not yet know how many jobs might be cut as a result of combining the two companies .
the merger still requires approval by regulators and both sets of shareholders but is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2002 .
lehman brothers was financial advisor to dynegy . j . p . morgan chase and salomon smith barney , a unit of citigroup , were financial advisors to enron .

enron not california ' s largest power supplier , but merger could affect prices

san francisco ( ap ) - when houston - based dynegy inc . announced friday that it had bought enron , its larger rival for $ 7 . 8 billion shares of stock , some energy traders predicted fluctuating power prices in the coming months throughout the west as the market settles into a new hierarchy with one fewer provider .
"" the fragility of the system is such that a small perturbation can turn everything upside down very easily , "" said gary ackerman , executive director of the western power trading forum , of which enron is a member . "" a week ago i don ' t think many people would have even contemplated this . ""
the loss of houston - based enron will "" make prices more jumpy and more uncertain and it ' s going to take the market some time to calm down , "" ackerman said . should the northwest have a chilly winter , prices could spike with fewer sellers in the market , he said .
and that in turn could affect california ' s pocketbook , though the state buys a negligible amount of electricity from enron , said oscar hidalgo , spokesman for the state department of water resources , which buys electricity for the customers of two financially ailing utilities . hidalgo said the state had a long - term contract with enron earlier this year though the marketer opted out of it after a month .
"" they have indicated to us that we were somewhat of a credit risk for them , like many generators at the time , "" hidalgo said .
earlier this year , enron attempted to cancel its contract as electricity and natural gas provider to california ' s two public university systems , which spent more than $ 170 million combined last year on the fuels . it was unclear friday what would happen to those contracts .
enron ' s reach in california goes beyond keeping the lights on .
the state ' s retirement pension fund owns 3 million shares of enron stock - about 1 percent of its total investments - said calpers spokeswoman pat macht . the calpers board will meet next week to discuss the situation , she said .
"" i can only say at this point that we were as surprised and shocked as the rest of the world was about what has been going on there and we ' re assessing our options , "" macht said .
enron corp . ' s outspoken support for deregulation of the country ' s electricity markets sparked resentment in california as rolling blackouts swept through earlier this year , although the energy marketer is not one of california ' s largest power providers .
some felt the financial downfall of the nation ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas and major electricity seller was justified .
"" the principles of karma seem to be working here , "" said harvey rosenfield , founder of the santa monica , calif . - based consumer advocacy group the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights . "" here enron was one of the chief proponents of deregulation and took advantage of it and benefitted enormously and now is reaping the consequences . ""
earlier this year , california attorney general bill lockyer subpoenaed enron ' s electricity trading records as he sought to prove the state was the victim of price gouging which led officials to spend more than $ 9 billion buying electricity for the customers of two financially troubled utilities . enron repeatedly denied all accusations of market manipulation .
enron , the nation ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas and the top wholesale marketer in the united states , had become one of the nation ' s 10 largest companies , recording revenue of $ 100 . 8 billion in 2000 .

dynegy - enron merger could mean name change for enron field

houston ( ap ) - the houston astros ' stadium won ' t be nicknamed "" home run field "" much longer .
houston - based energy marketer dynegy inc . announced friday that it will buy enron corp . , the $ 100 million namesake of the astros ' ballpark . the companies will operate independently until the deal closes , possibly next summer .
the new company will keep dynegy ' s name and lose enron ' s - and houston ' s $ 251 million ballpark could see the same change , astros owner drayton mclane jr . said .
mclane said the team ' s 30 - year naming rights agreement with enron allows another company to give the ballpark a new name in case of a merger . the astros have the right to approve or reject a change .
"" we want to work with ( dynegy chairman and chief executive ) chuck watson and we look forward to working with dynegy , "" mclane said .
watson said the ballpark name wasn ' t an issue as the companies hammered out the merger agreement this week .
"" quite honestly , it has not come up , "" watson said friday . "" this is about two strong companies going forward . it is something we will have to deal with in the months coming up . ""
since opening before the 2000 season , enron field has become known as one of the best parks for hitters in the majors . there have been 496 homers hit in enron the past two years , 19 percent more than in astros road games .
coincidentally , houston ' s other company - named sports facility also is in question . the corporate namesake of the compaq center basketball / hockey arena , compaq computer corp . , is being bought by hewlett - packard co .
enron field wouldn ' t be the first venue to change names because of a merger or other corporate decision by the naming - rights owner .
corestates arena , home to the philadelphia 76 ers and the philadelphia flyers , became first union arena when first union corp . acquired corestates financial corp . in 1998 .
marine midland arena in buffalo , n . y . , became hsbc arena last year because marine midland in 1999 changed its name to hsbc bank usa as part of a global branding strategy .
such changes are inevitable when 61 major league sports facilities bear corporate names in an age of many mergers and acquisitions , said dean bonham of the bonham group in denver , a sports and entertainment marketing firm .
"" mergers and acquisitions had no effect on the sports industry just 10 years ago , "" he said . "" today they can have a significant affect on the community beyond the direct impact on the company itself . ""
enron chairman and chief executive ken lay , who said friday he had been invited to serve on the new company ' s board of directors , helped create enron field before buying its name .
by 1996 mclane had determined it was time to move from the once - futuristic though aging astrodome , and threatened to sell part of the team and move to virginia unless a new ballpark was built in houston .
that year lay put together a consortium that provided a $ 34 . 7 million no - interest loan to buy the land in downtown houston and subsidize the 42 , 000 - seat ballpark ' s construction costs .
enron also manages the ballpark ' s mechanical and electrical equipment and energy services which officials said would earn up to $ 200 million over 30 years . mclane said dynegy likely would continue that deal .

under terms of its agreement with dynegy , chevrontexaco will be granted warrants to purchase an additional $ 1 . 5 billion of dynegy common stock over a period of up to three years from the completion of the merger .

rival to buy enron , top energy trader , after financial fall
by alex berenson and andrew ross sorkin

the new york times

c . 2 new york times company
with its stock plunging and its finances in doubt , the world ' s largest energy trader , the enron corporation , agreed to be acquired yesterday by the rival dynegy inc . for about $ 9 billion in stock and the assumption of $ 13 billion in debt .
the deal is an extraordinary turnabout for enron , a houston - based company that had been a driving force behind electricity deregulation nationwide .
its chairman , kenneth l . lay , a big contributor to the republican party , provided political influence , while its former chief executive , jeffrey k . skilling , helped create markets for the trading of electricity and natural gas . but last winter , when california ' s effort to deregulate the electricity market led to soaring power prices and rolling blackouts , enron was the subject of much criticism and political anger .
recent disclosures of discrepancies in enron ' s financial statements and an investigation by the securities and exchange commission caused the shares to plunge this week to their lowest level in a decade . as other companies became wary of doing business with it , enron - - also facing a potential cash squeeze - - apparently had little choice but to find a buyer , and a deal was hastily cobbled together this week .
for critics who had complained about enron ' s market power and its dominance , the combination poses additional concerns . dynegy ' s acquisition of enron will be reviewed by state and federal agencies , led by the justice department and the federal energy regulatory commission . analysts said today that they expected scrutiny of the combined companies ' holdings in california , where dynegy owns power - generating plants and enron accounts for much of the trading of natural gas - - fuel for the state ' s electric power plants .
buying enron at a deep discount - - it has lost $ 60 billion in market value this year - - could make dynegy the dominant trader of electricity and natural gas . but the agreement carries big risks as well . along with enron ' s gas pipelines and high - technology trading floor , dynegy will take on enron ' s substantial debt and a web of complex transactions that enron has spun over the last decade .
in addition to the $ 13 billion in debt that enron carries on its books , it has guaranteed at least $ 4 billion in off - balance sheet loans , and the hidden debt could total as much as $ 10 billion , said carol coale , a stock analyst with prudential securities .
charles l . watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , said yesterday that dynegy could sort through enron ' s tangled finances . ' ' we know the company well , ' ' mr . watson said . ' ' it ' s not like we just started fresh . i ' m confident that it ' s as solid as we thought it was . ' '
the new company will combine enron ' s 25 , 000 - mile natural gas pipeline system with the large number of power plants that dynegy owns worldwide , as well as illinois power , a dynegy subsidiary that serves 650 , 000 customers in illinois . but its most important asset will be its trading desk . it will be the largest energy trader in the nation , trading more than twice as much power and natural gas as its closest competitors .
mr . watson said the company did not expect to sell significant properties and that the deal should pass regulatory scrutiny . ' ' there ' s really not a lot of overlap in assets , ' ' he said .
mr . watson and steve bergstrom , dynegy ' s president , will hold those positions in the new company , which will be called dynegy and remain in houston . mr . lay , who created enron in the mid - 1980 ' s , will not have any role in the combined company ' s daily operations . he has been asked to join its board but has not provided an answer . ' ' the last three weeks haven ' t been a lot of fun , ' ' he said .
in a statement announcing the agreement yesterday afternoon , mr . watson said he was confident that the merger would produce a strong new company . ' ' enron is the ideal strategic partner for dynegy , ' ' mr . watson said . ' ' we will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key priorities . ' '
to shore up enron ' s finances , dynegy will immediately put $ 1 . 5 billion into enron through chevrontexaco , the giant oil company , which already owns 27 percent of dynegy . another billion dollars will be injected once the deal is completed .
investors appeared comfortable yesterday that dynegy could make the deal work . after falling $ 3 , to $ 33 , on wednesday , when the companies first said they were in discussions , dynegy rose $ 5 . 76 on thursday and yesterday to close the week at $ 38 . 76 .
' ' on paper , it works , ' ' ms . coale of prudential said . ' ' the combined company would be the leading trader , the market leader in most of their businesses . ' ' ms . coale , who has a sell rating on enron and a buy rating on dynegy , said she planned to keep her buy rating on dynegy .
as it works to have the deal approved , dynegy will have to persuade enron ' s traders to stay with the combined company . the pain of the stock ' s 90 percent plunge this year will not be equally shared . some enron employees have held onto their shares and seen their retirement accounts eviscerated . meanwhile , mr . lay , mr . skilling and other former and current executives sold hundreds of millions of dollars in enron stock in 2000 and this year .
the companies also have very different corporate cultures . dynegy emphasizes teamwork , while enron is more competitive , said ehud ronn , director of the center for energy finance education and research at the university of texas . even before the merger was announced , enron had lost some of its employees to other energy trading companies , mr . ronn said .
some investors and analysts say that the problems with enron ' s finances may extend beyond the partnerships that have been the subject of wall street ' s scrutiny the last month . james chanos , a short - seller who has been one of enron ' s most vocal critics , said there was increasing evidence that enron ' s energy trading operations were not as profitable as the company had said . ' ' there appears to be a culture at enron of aggressively booking profits and deferring or obscuring losses , ' ' mr . chanos said .
on thursday , enron said in a filing with the s . e . c that it had overstated its earnings by almost $ 600 million over the last five years . mr . chanos said more restatements were possible , noting that the filing disclosed partnerships had been used to hedge almost $ 1 billion in losses in 2000 and this year . so far , the losses from those partnerships remain off enron ' s financial statements , mr . chanos said .
enron ' s stock had been under pressure for most of this year , as the company ran up large losses with failed efforts to expand outside its core trading operation . in august , mr . skilling resigned as chief executive , and mr . lay resumed control of daily operations .
still , the company appeared financially sound until last month , when it disclosed that its shareholders ' equity , a measure of the company ' s value , dropped by $ 1 . 2 billion because of deals disclosed only hazily in its financial statements . the announcement unnerved investors , who wondered whether enron had found ways to inflate its profits and move debt off its balance sheet , and led the s . e . c . to begin an investigation .
mr . lay tried to reassure investors that enron ' s finances were in order and that its businesses remained strong . but the last three weeks have brought a series of damaging revelations about partnerships that enron formed with some of its top executives , including its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow .
with questions mounting , the major credit - rating agencies began to downgrade enron ' s debt , putting additional pressure on the company . if enron ' s debt rating falls below investment grade , it would be forced to repay $ 3 . 3 billion in loans that it had guaranteed .
to strengthen its balance sheet and bolster its stock , enron turned to big investors like warren e . buffett in search of billions of dollars of financing . when the financing did not quickly appear , its stock fell further .
by this week , some major energy traders were refusing to extend credit to enron , worrying that the company would be unable to make good on its contracts . the mirant corporation , an atlanta - based power plant owner and electricity trader , sharply curtailed its trading with enron this week . ' ' we ' re trading with them on a very limited basis , ' ' said james peters , a mirant spokesman . ' ' it ' s not business as usual . ' '
on wednesday , enron ' s stock fell as low as $ 7 a share , its lowest level in more than a decade . that day , news of the enron and dynegy talks leaked out .
by late wednesday , the boards of the two companies had tentatively agreed to a deal . but dynegy refused to go ahead until it learned whether enron ' s credit rating would remain investment grade and was comfortable with the effect of the deal on its own rating . the deal moved forward yesterday after dynegy was assured enron ' s debt was not in danger of being lowered to junk status soon after the deal was announced , according to company officials .
dynegy and enron had provided standard & poor ' s and moody ' s investors service , the main credit agencies , with statements showing them what a combined company might look like and asked the ratings agencies for an expedited review of the transaction , mr . watson said .
under the deal , enron shareholders will receive 0 . 2685 share of dynegy stock for each enron share , or $ 9 . 80 based on dynegy ' s closing price on thursday . enron ' s stock gained 22 cents yesterday , to $ 8 . 63 .
' ' i never thought our stock price would be at this level , ' ' mr . lay said yesterday .
enron ' s shareholders will own only 36 percent of the combined company , and dynegy will name at least 11 members of the company ' s 14 - member board .
if the deal falls apart , enron or dynegy will have to pay a breakup fee of $ 350 million .

regulators struggle with a marketplace created by enron

washington , nov . 9 - - for years , the enron corporation used its political muscle to build the markets in which it thrived , pushing relentlessly on capitol hill and in bureaucratic backwaters to deregulate the nation ' s natural gas and electricity businesses .
its achievement , as one enron executive said today , in creating a ' ' regulatory black hole ' ' fit nicely with what he called the company ' s ' ' core management philosophy , which was to be the first mover into a market and to make money in the initial chaos and lack of transparency . ' '
now , wall street ' s dissatisfaction with enron ' s secretive ways has delivered the company into the arms of its much smaller houston rival , dynegy inc . , in a deal worth about $ 9 billion in stock and the assumption of $ 13 billion in debt . the combination of the two companies , energy experts and lawmakers said today , poses a novel set of challenges for regulators still struggling to grasp the complexities of the marketplace that enron invented .
' ' we ' re in a supersonic - speed era of electronic trading with a horse - and - buggy - era regulatory system to protect consumers , ' ' said representative edward j . markey , a massachusetts democrat who has devised legislation to close the regulatory gap .
dynegy ' s acquisition of enron is expected to be reviewed by numerous state and federal agencies , led by the justice department , the federal trade commission and the federal energy regulatory commission .
analysts said today that sharp scrutiny would be given to the combined companies ' holdings in california , where dynegy owns generating plants and enron controls a large part of the market for trading natural gas - - the fuel for a big share of the state ' s electric power plants .
' ' dynegy would now have a greater ability to take the dominant position in gas and raise the price of electricity , ' ' said frank wolak , a professor of economics at stanford university .
mr . wolak , a consultant to the justice department on a 1999 antitrust case that led to limits on another merger of electricity and natural gas companies in southern california , said he was skeptical that regulators were up to the task of reviewing today ' s deal .
the transaction ' ' is something the department of justice needs to look at , and they are going to have a hard time looking at , ' ' mr . wolak said . ' ' and it ' s beyond the ability of the f . e . r . c . to look at . ' '
pat wood - - named chairman of the federal energy commission earlier this year with the backing of kenneth l . lay , the chairman of enron - - acknowledged in an interview today that the agency had ' ' a long way to go ' ' in matching the sophistication of the companies it regulates .
but he said that the commission had made great strides in grappling with the new risk management techniques pioneered by enron , dynegy and other energy companies . it is hiring more experts , he said , adopting more restrictive rules on how much ' ' market power ' ' one party can control and requiring more disclosure of certain energy transactions .
in an interview this evening , charles l . watson , the chairman of dynegy , said he did not believe that regulators reviewing the deal with enron would require the sale of any assets . ' ' we haven ' t really identified any pitfalls that require any sort of asset divestiture , ' ' he said . ' ' there ' s not really any overlap . ' '
a senior executive at one of enron ' s largest energy - trading rivals disagreed . ' ' i don ' t think this deal gets through unscathed , ' ' he said today . ' ' i ' m sure the justice department and the f . t . c . will look closely at the pretty substantial concentration of market power these companies will have in the energy - trading area . ' '
enron is mainly a trader of natural gas and electricity - - indeed , the biggest player in both those markets - - and it also owns a network of gas pipelines . dynegy processes and sells natural gas and generates and sells electricity . each company owns a local electric utility , too : dynegy owns illinois power in decatur , ill . , while enron owns portland general electric in portland , ore . , but last month announced plans to sell it to another oregon utility .
for a decade , as it transformed itself from a gas pipeline operator into the nation ' s biggest energy trader , enron enjoyed unalloyed lobbying success in washington and the enthusiastic backing of wall street .
in the early months of the bush administration , mr . lay - - whose company was one of the biggest financial backers of george w . bush ' s presidential campaign - - played a prominent , and some said unusual , role in helping the white house pick nominees to the federal energy commission . enron executives met with vice president dick cheney , whose energy task force backed many of the deregulatory initiatives pushed by mr . lay .
now , ' ' the company has become a pariah , ' ' an enron executive said today . ' ' the bush administration doesn ' t want to have anything to do with us . ' '
the problems began with the energy crisis in california , where enron ' s outspoken defense of deregulation , even more than its electricity trading activities , made the company a favorite whipping boy of politicians and consumer advocates . in the financial markets , meanwhile , enron ' s confusing disclosures , tolerated when its stock was soaring , drew disdain as the calming of the energy storms in california and other parts of the country beat the shares down , starting last spring .
' ' enron fell victim to their own inconsistencies on transparency , ' ' mr . wolak said . as california officials sought to understand why energy prices had soared out of control , he said , enron ' s ' ' view was that we want everybody ' s data , but if you want ours , get a subpoena . ' '
energy executives and regulators said that sort of arrogance had long marked enron ' s attitude about government oversight .
electricity sales had for decades been the job of local utility companies , operating as monopolies and selling power at regulated rates within their service areas . a few entrepreneurs , led by mr . lay , conceived a different model in which power could be sold by generators or middlemen to big corporate users or utilities in faraway regions , at whatever price the market would bear .
in the early 1990 ' s , congress - - under heavy lobbying by enron - - passed legislation that began to open up electricity sales to marketers . before long , enron became one of the first companies to receive government approval to sell electricity at market rates . the market for interstate sales of natural gas had been freed up a few years earlier , and critics complained that traders like enron were gleaning their profits by stoking volatility in gas prices .
in the mid - 1990 ' s , independent gas producers backed legislation in congress to allow the creation of a co - operative marketing organization , which , they hoped , would have helped stabilize prices .
raymond plank , the chairman of the apache corporation , a gas producer based in houston , said that the big gas marketing and trading companies , including enron , successfully lobbied to kill the plan , leaving prices as volatile as ever .
' ' it was a great concept , ' ' mr . plank said . ' ' we could have headed off the problems we have today . ' '
enron ' s final lobbying success came last year . with a strong push from the company ' s lobbyists , congress passed futures trading legislation that exempted internet energy trading platforms like enrononline , the industry leader , from oversight by the commodity futures trading commission . enron takes the other side of trades on its exchange . in traditional markets like the new york mercantile exchange , which remain subject to oversight , the exchange acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers .
under mr . watson , dynegy has been less of a pathbreaker than enron , and though california politicians denounced it , too , as a profiteer during the energy crisis , most analysts say it has been less aggressive than enron in both its business practices and its lobbying .
indeed , the rival energy - trading executive today predicted ' ' a huge culture clash ' ' as the houston neighbors merge . ' ' blood will flow in houston over the integration of the trading operation , ' ' he said .
but regulators may find dynegy easier to deal with .
earlier this year , the federal energy commission asked for comments on whether it should tighten scrutiny of dealings between natural gas pipelines and energy - trading shops owned by the same company .
enron wondered what all the bother was . ' ' would stricter rules prevent real affiliate abuse that current rules do not , ' ' it wrote in a regulatory filing , ' ' or would they instead merely restrict the activities of some of the more successful participants in the marketplace ? ' '
dynegy , by contrast , painted a grim picture and invited regulators to crack down . ' ' abuses abound , ' ' it said , ' ' because of financial windfalls , difficulty of detection , lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the market . ' '

companies in return chevrontexaco will be granted rights over $ 1 . 5 bn of dynegy stock .
jp morgan chase and citigroup demanded similar security for a $ 1 bn loan extended this month .
moody ' s investors service cut its rating on enron ' s senior unsecured debt yesterday morning from baa 2 to baa 3 - just one notch above junk status . any deeper downgrade would have forced enron to sell stock to cover about $ 3 . 3 bn of obligations , and could have deterred dynegy . moody ' s kept the ratings under review for further downgrades , given "" the potential for increased margin requirements from counterparties "" .
however , the agency said it would treat a substantial capital injection as "" a stabilising event "" . the deal is likely to face intense regulatory scrutiny , given the large share the combined companies would have in the energy markets .
the bid represents a reversal of fortune for enron , which will effectively be humbled by its smaller houston rival . however , some analysts expressed reservations , as enron faces a securities and exchange commission inquiry into off - balance sheet transactions , and a restatement of its accounts has yet to clear up questions about the true state of its financial dealings .
carol coale , of prudential securities , said : "" we believe that either dynegy had material exposure to enron ' s trading contracts or that it is trying to rescue its competitor by saving the liquidity in the commodities markets . ""

arthur andersen , enron ' s auditor , is understood to have approved the controversial off - balance sheet arrangements that lie at the heart of the energy company ' s decision to overhaul its accounts earlier this week .
however , in at least one case the auditor may not have been given full information , while the involvement in the disputed transactions of four people employed by enron has only recently come to light . andersen has already been hit by lawsuits from enron shareholders filed in oregon and harris county , texas - a popular venue among plaintiffs ' lawyers given its history of big jury awards .
the legal actions are the latest blow to an auditing profession still reeling in the aftermath of a series of accounting scandals that have blown up in recent years . on wednesday , waste management said andersen would pay $ 20 m to settle a suit brought by shareholders in the trash hauler alleging professional malpractice . the securities and exchange commission has already agreed a $ 7 m settlement with andersen over the alleged audit fraud .
the enron actions could also turn out to be one of the first tests of new auditor independence rules set by the sec . the energy company paid andersen $ 25 m for its audit last year and $ 27 m for other services .
an andersen spokesman refused to comment on whether the auditor had vetted the complex off - balance sheet arrangements used by enron to manage its trading risks and offload debt . however , he added : "" we do help companies understand accounting rules and how to apply them . ""
in a regulatory filing on thursday , enron indicated that its decision to restate its accounts to include two off - balance companies was based on "" current information "" , suggesting that full details had not been available before .
however , a third accounting change was based on a new "" assessment "" , enron said , raising questions about the auditor ' s earlier judgement .
under the previous commissioner arthur levitt , the sec attacked companies that indulged in "" earnings management "" and accountants who suffered from conflicts of interest between audit and consulting work . the accounting firms say audit and consulting work can co - exist .

being in the business , dynegy should have a better idea than other possible buyers of what it is taking on . presumably it has been given a fuller and franker explanation of enron ' s off - balance - sheet mess than its investors , but it can scarcely have been able to carry out what normally counts as due diligence .
moody ' s decision and s & p ' s indecision meant enron kept its investment grade and seems to have got the deal done . do ratings agencies really provide independent analysis at these times ? if dynegy injects $ 1 . 5 bn of cash up front , courtesy of chevron texaco and secured on the pipeline assets , that averts the immediate crisis . an exchange ratio of 0 . 27 would value enron ' s stock at $ 8 bn . at about $ 10 . 67 a share that is a 27 per cent premium , but more pertinently compares with $ 34 on the eve of the october earnings call and $ 83 on new year ' s day . there are no rivals for this year ' s prize for shareholder value destruction . others have gone , but did ken lay , enron chief executive , know what was going on ? whatever the answer , it reflects poorly on him .
the merger raises antitrust questions . dynegy might be a fifth of enron ' s size , but it is the second biggest energy trader . but while enron has few friends in the public markets it still has some in high places . dynegy ' s offer puts a floor beneath enron ' s share price . paying bottom dollar provides some insurance for its shareholders . as more emerges on the financial structure and the state of the core trading business , the question is whether those who declined the opportunity start to take an interest or pat themselves on the back .

companies continental has had to lay off 12 , 000 employees ; and energy trader enron has gone from being the leader of houston ' s business community to its biggest liability .
the fourth most populous city in the us is reeling from the latest demise among its corporate citizens .
"" it ' s a body blow , "" says charlie savino , executive vice - president of the greater houston partnership , a business organisation .
enron is not only one of the city ' s biggest employers ; it has led the redevelopment of downtown houston , making it somewhere pleasant to live for the first time in decades .
at the centre of its efforts is the enron field , which the company financed to bring professional baseball - and its fans - back into the city centre .
on the periphery are enron ' s contributions to houston ' s social development .
the company matches all employee donations made to non - profit organisations , for up to $ 15 , 000 per employee , per year .
it also makes donations to non - profit organisations for which its employees offer their time .
kenneth lay , enron chief executive , has long been the "" go - to guy "" to get something done in houston .
enron ' s status brought houston status ; as the biggest energy trader in the us , it made the city the centre of energy trading . enrononline , its internet trading platform , has drawn some of the brightest minds to the city to work on what has become the world ' s biggest web - based transaction system .
enron was so secure in its standing that it was building a new 40 - storey office building adjoining its 50 - storey tower .
beside that , bulldozers and cranes have been putting the finishing touches to a massive new parking garage .
employees had just started to move into the new towers when a series of disclosures about enron ' s financial position began to undermine the company and send investors fleeing for cover .
enron staff , once known for being both brilliant and arrogant enough to prove it , are coping with their dramatic reversal in status in a wide variety of ways .
as they left work yesterday , many brushed by in their smart - casual polo shirts and khakis , refusing to say a word about what was unfolding .
one man , looking exhausted , braved a grin and said : "" just keep smiling . the world goes on . companies go through problems all the time , just like we do in personal life . ""
one woman felt she had to laugh at the irony : she moved to enron last year to protect herself from job losses in the more traditional energy businesses . at that time , enron was considered the safest place to be in the industry .
that dynegy , another houston - based energy trader , has emerged as enron ' s saviour is being received positively by staff , who praised its technology and processes .
the houston business community may be hoping that a merged group might be better for the city than a stand - alone enron , as a combined business would be bigger and stronger .
but john olson , of sanders morris harris , a local investment banking and securities firm in houston , notes that a merger is likely to lead to job losses , as assets are sold and businesses are streamlined .
already , he says , many houston citizens , big holders of enron ' s stock , had lost out on its share slide . "" the ripple effects on the city will be immeasurable , "" he says .

copyright ? 2000 dow jones enron has more than 7 , 000 here .
for watson , the deal is all about growth .
"" it accelerates our strategy some three or four years , "" he said shortly after the deal was announced . "" this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies . ""
this isn ' t the way ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , ever thought his years of work would turn out .
"" this would not have been my dream case , "" lay said in an interview with the chronicle shortly after the deal was announced . "" i would not even have contemplated it three or four weeks ago . ""
lay has been offered a seat on the combined company ' s board , but hasn ' t decided yet whether to take it . he won ' t have any management role once the deal closes .
he helped take enron from a staid pipeline company created from a 1985 merger to a trading machine that wheels and deals in gas , electricity , financial contracts used to help companies manage risk and other commodities .
but lay said he believed selling enron was the best option for its shareholders , employees and the city considering the company ' s current battered state .
"" this is the best way to provide certainty to protect this wholesale marketing and trading franchise which is so valuable , "" he said , adding that enron looked at two or three other alternatives as it tried to strengthen its balance sheet and add cash into its operations .
lay said it ' s not his preference to sell enron and see its name disappear .
"" it happens to be the best alternative , "" said lay . "" i ' m a realist . i knew what needed to be done . ""
among enron ' s troubles : the securities and exchange commission is investigating business deals enron did with two investment partnerships run by its former chief financial officer , its credibility on wall street is close to zero , a pile of shareholder lawsuits and its credit rating , which it relies on to successfully run its core trading business , has been lowered .
while other questions had hung over enron earlier this year , the path to its end really began oct . 16 , when the company released third - quarter earnings and reported significant financial losses related to the two investment partnerships .
that set in motion a spiral of events leading to friday ' s announcement .
watson called lay on oct . 24 to see if he could do anything to help dispel rumors that dynegy had stopped trading with enron .
that conversation led to a meeting at lay ' s house three days later , at which the two started talking about a deal .
as these things go , the deal came together quickly , especially with so many question marks hanging over enron .
"" i think it ' s important to understand that ken and i have known each other for some 20 years , "" watson said . "" we have a good understanding of what they do and how they do it . we knew that their franchise was solid . ""
under the terms of the deal , which is expected to close in six to nine months :
enron shareholder ' s get 0 . 2685 share of dynegy per enron share . based on friday ' s closing stock prices of $ 8 . 63 for enron and $ 38 . 76 for dynegy , dynegy is paying $ 10 . 41 an enron share - or a 21 percent premium . that ' s a far cry from late january when enron ' s closing price hit $ 82 a share .
dynegy will immediately inject $ 1 . 5 billion in enron to help shore it up . dynegy will get that money from chevrontexaco , which owns about 26 percent of dynegy .
in return for that money , dynegy will get preferred stock and other rights in enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline system . should the deal not close , dynegy has the right to buy all of northern natural gas .
at the deal ' s closing , chevrontexaco will provide another $ 1 billion to the combined company .
enron will have the right to designate at least three board members for the combined company , which will have 14 board seats .
steve bergstrom , dynegy ' s president , and rob doty , dynegy ' s chief financial officer , will keep those roles in the new company . greg whalley , currently president and chief operating officer of enron , will become an executive vice president at the combined company .
the deal contains a $ 350 million breakup fee that dynegy would get if another suitor came in and enron decided to take a better offer .
watson also said the deal contains escape clauses to protect dynegy should it be necessary , but he doesn ' t expect any surprises .
"" we looked under the hood and guess what , it ' s just as strong as we thought it was , "" he said .
the deal must be reviewed by a variety of government regulators , though watson isn ' t expecting any antitrust problems .
dynegy will talk to analysts and investors on a conference call monday , attempting to convince them of the deal ' s value . dynegy expects the merger to result in $ 400 million to $ 500 million in annual savings .
"" on paper , it looks good , "" said coale , the analyst . "" we still remain concerned about the uncertainties that shroud enron . . . the risks continue to be what we don ' t know about enron . we just hope chuck and his team do all the necessary due diligence , which is going to take more than a couple weeks . ""
there are also concerns about merging two different cultures .
"" looking at cultures , the two companies are very different , "" she said . "" dynegy is a little bit of a fraternity . chuck started this company and i ' m sure he has a heartfelt emotion toward making things work at dynegy . enron is a mercenary , aggressive , cutthroat culture . ""
while both are energy traders , enron has pursued a strategy of shedding assets , while dynegy has continued to make asset purchases .
at the start of the year , enron was still heralded as an innovator for others to emulate . since , a series of problems began chipping away at enron ' s image .
but such concerns were mostly pushed aside for as long as the company ' s stock price performed well and its core energy trading business turned out higher and still - higher profits .
the company ' s woes became more serious and quickly multiplied after it made troubling financial disclosures in its third - quarter earnings report oct . 16 .
it disclosed that day it had taken a $ 35 million loss and reduced shareholders equity by $ 1 . 2 billion related to ending business dealings with two investment partnerships formerly run by andrew fastow , its chief financial officer .
the disclosures heightened wall street ' s ongoing concerns that enron ' s financial reporting was too difficult to understand and skimped on details . it also led to fears that enron would be on the hook for billions of dollars related to other financial vehicles .
days later , enron revealed that the sec was investigating transactions between enron and the partnerships , called ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment . it also replaced fastow and has been hit with a growing number of shareholder lawsuits .
then , the company ' s credit rating was downgraded , which raised questions about its ability to manage its core energy trading business .
as wall street ' s questions grew , enron retreated into silence , leaving analysts and investors to speculate on worst - case scenarios , which fed fears that company was facing a cash - crunch and caused investors to keep dumping the stock .
that in turn , led some of enron ' s trading partners to shift business elsewhere and raise their credit requirements to do business with enron , which in turn , raised even more fears .
thursday , enron said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships it created .

the famous baseball manager casey stengel was smart to advise , "" never make predictions , especially about the future , "" ken lay once wrote in an essay on world energy needs .
lay might be taking those words to heart today .
as the chairman of enron corp . predicted not long ago , "" we can see some very significant growth with several years to come . ""
once considered one of the shining stars of the energy business , lay has watched the company he helped create melt down around him in a matter of weeks .
and as of friday , he was left to ponder an offer to serve as a member of the board for the new company formed from enron and its chief rival - no longer a chairman or a chief executive .
perhaps that ' s the way he wants it .
when he turned over the chief executive ' s post at enron to jeffrey skilling earlier this year , it seemed like the first move of his orderly exit from the company he had helped create in the mid - 1980 s .
eleven months later , skilling is gone and lay has had to preside over the death of enron .
what had begun as a stodgy natural gas pipeline company had been molded and expanded by the two men into a diversified financial giant with its hands in countless markets from oil and natural gas to water and broadband .
it seemed lay , 58 , who is an economist by profession , had also cemented his reputation as an elder statesman in the energy industry , the man who had opened the business world ' s eyes to the array of possibilities that energy companies could explore for growth away from their traditional roles .
with the implosion of enron in the past month , lay ' s legacy now seems tarnished . the man who was once referred to as an "" energetic messiah "" has been forced to sell off his creation in a fire sale to rival dynegy in a hastily arranged deal . lay ' s approach is reflected in the design of the building enron is constructing across from its existing tower on smith street . looking down on the massive trading floor are two offices built for lay and skilling .
the offices were considered symbolic of the company ' s openness and its philosophy of melding executives with the rank and file . lay reportedly spurned the express elevator to ride to his 50 th - floor office to spend more time with employees .
that sort of hands - on approach lay brought to the company may be another casualty , analysts said .
"" i would be surprised if he had much of a role in running things from a day - to - day perspective , "" said brian youngberg , energy analyst with edward jones in st . louis . "" i think dynegy will be running the ship and plug in some enron executives . ""
as the dust settles on enron , the question is being raised as to whether the company became too big for one or two men to run in a hands - on fashion .
"" ken lay helped build enron from being just a pipeline company , but over time the company got so big and complex that it was too hard for one or two senior executives to completely oversee things and to know fully what was going on in the operating companies , "" youngberg said .
raised on a farm in missouri , lay is well - known not just as chairman of enron but as a former undersecretary of the interior department and one of the people who has helped shape houston ' s destiny in the past 20 years . he is considered instrumental in keeping major league baseball in houston by supporting the construction of enron field .
but his lasting legacy will likely be as one of the key people who helped create the huge natural gas futures market in the united states , which was nonexistent as recently as the late 1980 s . he also will be remembered as the man who led others to view the energy business as one integrated market and not individual fiefdoms .
"" ken lay really did educate his peers to understand the broadness of his business , "" said amy jaffe , a senior energy analyst with rice university ' s james a . baker iii institute for public policy . "" whether his retirement is under positive or negative circumstances , he has left a huge legacy on the industry . ""
jaffe sees lay as the person who got oil and gas executives to break out of the old mentality and explore new technologies such as fuel cells and wind power . he also was a leading proponent of natural gas and power deregulation .
he will leave enron a wealthy man , although much less so since the company ' s stock nose - dived . his current contract pays him a base salary of $ 1 . 4 million a year and a bonus of $ 7 million . it was due to expire in december 2003 .
this is not the first time lay has had to rescue enron . in 1987 , enron was rocked by the disclosure that rogue traders at its enron oil co . had left the company holding the bag for about $ 1 billion in trading liabilities . before disclosing it to the market , the company worked the trading loss down to about $ 142 million .
"" we learned a lot , certainly in a bad way , "" lay said of the incident in an interview earlier this year . "" we put in place probably the best risk management and control system , not just in our business , but in any industry . ""
some see irony in the fact that dynegy ceo chuck watson will likely prevail over lay despite lay ' s almost cult status among business leaders and business school professors .
"" chuck watson was underrated in his role in forming the natural gas market in the united states . he was the man who realized the enormous potential of the natural gas market , "" jaffe said . "" it ' s true that enron came in with a lot of advertising and built up a big position , but maybe there is some poetic justice that the man who really started the natural gas clearinghouse could wind back up as the dominant player in the industry . ""

"" he doesn ' t act like a big shot , "" said tilman fertitta , the chairman of landry ' s restaurants , who likes driving a bentley and zipping around in a helicopter . "" chuck ' s not all caught up in the houston hustle - and - bustle thing . ""
like it or not , watson is about to step out in a big way . if dynegy completes the acquisition of enron for $ 8 . 85 billion in stock , watson will become captain of houston ' s largest company . he will step right into the center of the city ' s business stage , taking from enron chairman ken lay the mantle of most powerful businessman in a city where commerce and the deal have always come first .
those who know watson say he should have little trouble adapting to his higher profile and is ready for the many demands that will inexorably follow .
"" chuck is a guy who knows what he wants and goes and gets it , "" fertitta said . "" he is not intimidated . ""
in fact , when longtime friend steve patterson read about enron ' s nose - dive and the collapse of its stock , he instinctively knew watson would close in on a deal .
"" i thought : ` you know what , chuck will try to buy enron . it just fits . it ' s the big bold move that chuck would try to make , ' "" said patterson , senior vice president of the houston texans football team . watson owns 15 percent of the texans , the largest chunk outside of the piece owned by club founder bob mcnair . watson also owns the houston aeros hockey team .
like enron chairman ken lay , watson was a pioneer in the deregulation of the energy business . he was one of the early innovative forces that shaped the world of trading electricity and swapping natural gas .
watson was born 51 years ago on the great lakes naval base north of chicago . his father worked for the navy , which moved the young watson clan around early and often . chuck watson had attended more than 20 schools in nine states when he graduated from oklahoma state university in 1972 with a degree in economics .
after a 13 - year career at conoco , watson joined a fledgling company called u . s . natural gas clearinghouse in 1985 . ngc was a consortium of gas pipelines that had the backing of a financial - services company and a local law firm , but conflicts among the partners hamstrung the little company .
watson would not join the company until it was overhauled and most of the quarreling partners were bought out . watson ' s vision was to buy the gas and take title to it , aggregate big volumes and leverage that to make bigger deals and negotiate better rates from the pipelines that moved the gas around .
in short , the company moved beyond being a broker and became a wholesale store for natural gas .
"" he is a visionary in the energy business , "" said bob mcnair , a longtime friend who founded cogen technologies and later sold the company to enron for $ 1 . 1 billion . "" chuck will come across as this relaxed , country person . not some sophisticate . but that is disarming . he is very creative , and he is very smart . ""
while ngc initially concentrated on gathering , moving and trading natural gas , the business has broadened along with the quickening pace of energy deregulation . now called dynegy , short for dynamic energy , the company has evolved into an outfit that sells power directly to commercial and industrial users of electricity and natural gas . it also has built a communications division to capitalize on increasing demand for high - speed communication services .
last year the company recorded an astounding 230 percent rise in net income , as well as a 91 percent jump in operating revenues . dynegy ' s stock climbed 218 percent last year .
"" the success of dynegy is a tremendous story , "" patterson said . "" it is amazing the growth and the value he has been able to achieve . ""
according to some of those who ' ve have done business with him , watson is not just bright , he is extraordinarily tough .
"" he is a very aggressive person , a tough negotiator . he bores in , "" said george mitchell , founder of mitchell energy and the man who carved the woodlands out of the piney forest . "" he is a very confident person . unlike ken lay , who is a smoother type personality who works with people , watson is going to do it his way . they are both very good business people , but they are very different . ""
while willing to give power to his subordinates , watson is a hands - on ceo who is unmistakably dynegy ' s commanding force .
"" chuck is very , very intense . . . he burns , "" said former houston mayor bob lanier . "" in negotiations , he gets down and learns all the details himself . ""
how tough watson is willing to be came to light in his contentious dealings with houston rockets owner les alexander . watson owned the master lease to the summit , later renamed the compaq center , which committed the rockets to playing there through 2003 . eager to break the deal , alexander tried negotiating and litigating his way out of the lease , all to no avail .
the battle deepened as the two men competed unsuccessfully to get a nhl hockey team in houston and feuded over how a hockey team would share in the revenues of a new stadium proposed for downtown .
angered at the deal alexander was able to get for the rockets , at the expense of a hockey franchise , watson spent about $ 100 , 000 out of his own pocket to help defeat the stadium referendum . it was his one overtly political act here , and some say it was the decisive blow to alexander ' s aspirations .
"" there are a lot of people i ' d much rather have a contest with , "" lanier said of watson .
alexander and watson were later able to settle their differences , and watson supported the second arena referendum , which passed . a basketball arena is now under construction downtown .
"" i ' m not surprised to see chuck watson make an aggressive move like this , "" alexander said friday evening . "" he understands the industry as well as anyone ; and therefore , he ' s in the best position to assess the risk and take advantage of the opportunity . ""
like most opportunities , the deal also represents a sizable risk . taking over enron is a huge reach for dynegy , which will try to swallow a company that was five times bigger when measured by revenues .
watson will need all of his shrewdness and ferocity to untangle the mess that is enron and merge two operations that were each , in their own way , trying to reinvent the energy business .
"" i have some concerns for my friend , "" mcnair confessed . "" it is a tremendous challenge . i know he ' ll handle it well , but this will be a very demanding business . ""

enron corp . , the once - highflying energy giant whose aggressive efforts to profit from california ' s energy deregulation made it a target of consumer and political backlash , on friday agreed to be saved from possible financial collapse through a proposed acquisition by rival dynegy inc .
the roughly $ 7 . 7 - billion deal is a stunning plot twist for houston - based enron , which was vilified in california as it was being glorified on wall street . in only the last month , a series of disturbing financial revelations pushed to the edge of ruin this once - powerful company , whose top executives had lectured california on its energy foibles and who influenced the direction of national energy policy .
enron muscled its way to the top of the energy heap using aggressive and , in the end , financially suspect strategies that proved its undoing .
now , the company that late last year had a market value of $ 63 billion is worth one - tenth that and has agreed to be swallowed by a cross - town competitor one - quarter its size . enron ' s proud and influential chairman and chief executive , kenneth l . lay , who became a focus of bitter attacks by california politicians and regulators , would lose his job , as would many others at enron .
even the name would disappear . the combined company would be called dynegy inc . if the deal receives all the necessary regulatory and shareholder approvals .
california officials took no joy in enron ' s fate friday , though there was perhaps some sense of retribution from its many critics in the state .
"" this is basically a rogue corporation , "" said sen . steve peace ( d - el cajon ) , an outspoken critic of enron for years who dealt with the company as he chaired the committee that hammered out the legislative portion of california ' s landmark electricity deregulation plan in 1996 . "" it has from the beginning been a rogue corporation which answered in its mind to a higher law - - a fundamental belief that there are laws of economics that supersede the law of the land . ""
a failed experiment
steve maviglio , spokesman for gov . gray davis , said that although enron was never a major force in california ' s doomed electricity market , it was outspoken in support of deregulation .
"" in a sense , their experiment was much like california ' s experiment - - a failure , "" he said .
said harvey rosenfield , president of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights in santa monica : "" nothing could better illustrate the disaster of deregulation than the fact that one of its biggest proponents , which reaped the reward of deregulation , is suffering the consequences . ""
enron is the world ' s largest energy trader , handling one of four energy deals in the united states through its online trading operation , enrononline . since it reported a surprising third - quarter loss on oct . 16 , partly tied to shadowy investment vehicles , enron has endured a huge loss of investor confidence , which brought on a massive cash crunch and some shrinkage of its trading business .
under the deal announced friday , dynegy , invited in two weeks ago after enron fell short in its efforts to line up new financing , would immediately help enron by pouring $ 1 . 5 billion in cash into the company . the money would be provided by chevrontexaco corp . , the san francisco oil company that owns nearly 27 % of dynegy .
enron shareholders would get 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share , which values the company at about $ 7 . 7 billion based on friday ' s stock close . dynegy shares surged $ 2 . 26 to close at $ 38 . 76 per share on the new york stock exchange ; enron added 22 cents to close at $ 8 . 63 per share , still off 89 % year to date .
if the deal closes in six to nine months , as the parties expect , dynegy and chevrontexaco would invest $ 1 billion additionally in the combined company .
"" this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies , "" said charles l . watson , dynegy chairman and chief executive , who will head the combined company . watson said the merger would immediately add to dynegy ' s earnings .
even so , the repercussions of enron ' s fall from grace could be far - reaching . coming on the heels of california ' s energy crisis , enron ' s troubles may slow the country ' s march toward energy deregulation , which lay and enron championed for years as a potential boon to consumers and the economy in general .
but the deal announced friday will prevent an even worse outcome , energy experts said : the threatened collapse of enron , which would clog up for a time the business of buying and selling electricity , natural gas and oil . that could interfere with delivery of energy around the country , they said .
"" this is an encouraging development for the energy industry , "" said stephen baum , chairman of sempra energy , the san diego - based parent of southern california gas and san diego gas ; photographer : associated press ; photo : "" this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies , "" says charles l . watson , dynegy chairman and chief executive . ; ; photographer : associated press
copyright ? 2000 dow jones enron has more than 7 , 000 here .
for watson , the deal is all about growth .
"" it accelerates our strategy some three or four years , "" he said shortly after the deal was announced . "" this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies . ""
this isn ' t the way ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , ever thought his years of work would turn out .
"" this would not have been my dream case , "" lay said in an interview with the chronicle shortly after the deal was announced . "" i would not even have contemplated it three or four weeks ago . ""
lay has been offered a seat on the combined company ' s board , but hasn ' t decided yet whether to take it . he won ' t have any management role once the deal closes .
he helped take enron from a staid pipeline company created from a 1985 merger to a trading machine that wheels and deals in electricity gas , electricity , financial contracts used to help companies manage risk and other commodities .
but lay said he believed selling enron was the best option for its shareholders , employees and the city considering the company ' s current battered state .
"" this is the best way to provide certainty to protect this wholesale marketing and trading franchise which is so valuable , "" he said , adding that enron looked at two or three other alternatives as it tried to strengthen its balance sheet and add cash to into its operations .
lay said it ' s not his preference to sell enron and see its name disappear .
"" it happens to be the best alternative , "" said lay . "" i ' m a realist . i knew what needed to be done . ""
among enron ' s troubles : the securities and exchange commission is investigating business deals enron did with two investment partnerships run by its former chief financial officer , its credibility on wall street is close to zero , a pile of shareholder lawsuits and its credit rating , which it relies on to successfully run its core trading business , has been lowered .
while other questions had hung over enron earlier this year , the path to its end really began oct . 16 , when the company released third - quarter earnings and reported significant financial losses related to the two investment partnerships .
that set in a motion a spiral of events leading to friday ' s announcement .
watson called lay on oct . 24 to see if he could do anything to help dispel rumors that dynegy had stopped trading with enron .
that conversation led to a meeting at lay ' s house days later , at which the two started talking about a deal .
as these things go , the deal came together quickly , especially with so many question marks hanging over enron .
"" i think it ' s important to understand that ken and i have known each other for some 20 years , "" watson said . "" we have a good understanding of what they do and how they do it . we knew that their franchise was solid . ""
the recent talks , watson said , focused on really understanding enron ' s core business and how it could merge with dynegy .
added lay : "" good deals come together fast . bad deals take a little longer . ""
under the terms of the deal , which is expected to close in six to nine months :
enron shareholder ' s get 0 . 2685 share of dynegy per enron share .
dynegy will immediately inject $ 1 . 5 billion in enron to help shore it up . dynegy will get that money from chevrontexaco , which owns about 26 percent of dynegy .
in return for that money , dynegy will get preferred stock and other rights in enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline system . should the deal not close , dynegy has the right to buy all of northern natural gas .
at the deal ' s closing , chevrontexaco will provide another $ 1 billion to the combined company .
also at the closing , dynegy ' s current shareholders will own about 64 percent of the combined company , with enron ' s current shareholder ' s owning about 36 percent .
enron will have the right to designate at least three board members for the combined company , which will have 14 board seats .
steve bergstrom , dynegy ' s president , and rob doty , dynegy ' s chief financial officer , will keep those roles in the new company . greg whalley , currently president and chief operating officer of enron , will became an executive vice president at the combined company .
the deal contains $ 350 million breakup free that dynegy would get it another suitor came in and enron decided to take a better offer .
watson also said the deal contains escape clauses to protect dynegy should it be necessary , but he doesn ' t expect any surprises .
"" we looked under the hood and guess what , it ' s just as strong as we thought it was , "" he said .
dynegy will talk to analysts and investors on a conference call monday , attempting to convince them of the deal ' s value .
"" on paper , it looks good , "" said coale , the analyst . "" we still remain concerned about the uncertainties that shroud enron . . . the risks continue to be what we don ' t know about enron . we just hope chuck and his team do all the necessary due diligence , which is going to take more than a couple weeks . ""
there are also concerns about merging two different cultures .
"" looking at cultures , the two companies are very different , "" she said . "" dynegy is a little bit of a fraternity . chuck started this company and i ' m sure he has a heartfelt emotion toward making things work at dynegy . enron is a mercenary , aggressive , cutthroat culture . ""
at the start of the year , enron was still heralded as an innovator for others to emulate . since , a series of problems began chipping away at enron ' s image .
but such concerns were mostly pushed aside for as long as the company ' s stock price performed well and its core energy trading business turned out higher and still - higher profits .
the company ' s woes became more serious and quickly multiplied after it made troubling financial disclosures in its third - quarter earnings report oct . 16 .
it disclosed that day it had taken a $ 35 million loss and reduced shareholders equity by $ 1 . 2 billion related to ending business dealings with two investment partnerships formerly run by andrew fastow , its chief financial officer .
the disclosures heightened wall street ' s ongoing concerns that enron ' s financial reporting was too difficult to understand and skimped on details . it also led to fears that enron would be on the hook for billions of dollars related to other financial vehicles .
days later , enron revealed that the sec was investigating transactions between enron and the partnerships , called ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment . it also replaced fastow and has been hit with a growing number of shareholder lawsuits .
then , the company ' s credit rating was downgraded , which raised questions about its ability to manage its core energy trading business .
as wall street ' s questions grew , enron retreated into silence , leaving analysts and investors to speculate on worst - case scenarios , which fed fears that company was facing a cash - crunch and caused investors to keep dumping the stock .
that in turn , led some of enron ' s trading partners to shift business elsewhere and raise their credit requirements to do business with enron , which in turn , raised even more fears about a cash - crunch and the company ' s short - term stability .
thursday , enron said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships it created .

embattled enron corp . yesterday accepted a buyout offer valued at about $ 8 billion from crosstown rival dynegy inc . if the deal is completed , it would end houston - based enron ' s reign as the leader in the huge energy trading markets that set the prices of power and natural gas in the nation .
its cash dwindling and its credit rating hammered , enron was forced to the negotiating table after its recent disclosures that its obligations to a complex web of partnerships involving company officials had caused the trading powerhouse to overstate its earnings and obscure its total debt obligations . four top enron officials have resigned or been replaced since july and , once dynegy takes control , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , kenneth lay , will also leave the company . lay said yesterday that he had not decided whether to accept dynegy ' s offer to serve on the combined company ' s board .
"" it ' s been a good ride for a long time , "" lay said in a conference call last night . "" the last three weeks haven ' t been a whole lot of fun . ""
the final deal was announced after the close of stock trading . enron ' s shares - - which had fallen from $ 33 to $ 8 after the disclosures - - ended the day slightly higher , at $ 8 . 63 . dynegy ' s stock closed at $ 38 . 76 , up $ 2 . 26 .
dynegy offered all stock for the enron shares , so the total value of the deal will fluctuate with dynegy ' s stock price . dynegy also said it would assume about $ 13 billion in enron debt , bringing the total value of the transaction to around $ 21 billion .
dynegy ' s rescue of enron will begin with an immediate cash infusion of $ 1 . 5 billion , which will be supplied by chevrontexaco corp . , a major dynegy stockholder . chevrontexaco will invest another $ 1 billion in dynegy after the acquisition has passed regulatory review and is completed , which executives said they expect will take six to nine months as enron tries to unscramble the complex partnerships that are now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission .
the takeover agreement gives dynegy an escape clause permitting it to cancel the purchase if enron winds up with heavy regulatory fines or legal judgments from shareholder suits tied to its handling of the partnerships .
chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , said in the conference call that a close scrutiny over the past two weeks of enron ' s financial condition convinced him that the company ' s trading and pipeline businesses were solid . "" we looked under the hood , and guess what ? it looked just as strong as we thought it was . "" watson said he did not think more damaging disclosures were forthcoming from enron .
until the partnership mess , enron was the nation ' s dominant energy trader , and it had front - door political connections to the white house . lay , its longtime chairman , raised more then $ 100 , 000 for the presidential election campaign of his friend george w . bush . enron rode the growth of energy trading markets beginning in the mid - 1990 s , as first natural gas , and then electric power sales were deregulated at the wholesale level . its revenues leaped from $ 9 . 2 billion in 1995 to $ 100 . 8 billion last year .
during those heady times , the houston company could choose which questions to answer about its dealings with related partnerships and its byzantine bookkeeping .
"" it was always very difficult to get information , "" said louis b . gagliardi , an analyst with john s . herold inc . "" they would always rebuff you . ""
until this fall , the muscular company seemed too big to stumble , said investment manager david coxe , with harris insight equity fund in chicago .
coxe bought 78 , 000 shares of enron at $ 40 a share in august , after wrestling with the decision for months , he said . then jeffrey skilling , enron ' s chief executive and strategic mastermind , unexpectedly resigned . the stock , which had been as high as $ 90 in august 2000 , pitched downward .
"" enron seemed so indispensable to the nation ' s energy markets that i thought it inconceivable it could implode , "" coxe said . "" that ' s how i got sucked in . ""
enron ' s fall is "" classic hubris , "" coxe said : a greek tragedy striking someone who chose to defy the gods - - "" in this case , the rules of the system . ""
among the rules that enron now acknowledges it didn ' t follow were the accounting standards that applied to the complex partnerships it created . the purpose of the partnerships , enron said , was to reduce the risks of investments in internet transmission systems and to sell power plants and other assets it no longer wanted .
the accounting errors were described in a 20 - page sec filing enron made thursday . the errors resulted in a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in the value of shareholders ' equity . the company also said it had overstated its earnings by $ 586 million since 1997 .
enron created partnerships that would buy major assets - - such as a power plant - - that enron wanted to sell , or in other cases , assets such as fiber - optic cable networks that enron intended to run but did not want to have on its balance sheet .
the partnerships had outside investors , but the general partner of two of them was enron ' s own chief financial officer , andrew fastow . he earned $ 30 million in fees from managing two of the largest partnerships , according to the sec document .
enron added to the capital of these partnerships by pledging its stock , or securities convertible into stock . some of those stock transactions should have been counted as loans , resulting in the $ 1 . 2 billion drop in shareholder equity , enron now says .
investors are asking why enron ' s auditor , arthur andersen llp , did not insist that these transactions be handled that way in the first place . enron ' s sec filing mentions but does not explain some "" proposed audit adjustments "" over the past four years that were overruled .
even though , as enron now acknowledges , it created an information barrier , masking critical information and violating standard accounting rules , many financial analysts who were recommending the stock to investors were not pushing hard enough to punch through that barrier , some analysts acknowledge .
"" it was so complicated that everybody was afraid to raise their hands and say , ' i don ' t understand it , ' "" gagliardi said .
the questions are now coming , from a new committee reporting to enron ' s board that will investigate how the company ' s financial reporting was handled ; from the sec ; and , eventually , from teams of lawyers representing aggrieved shareholders .
lay indicated yesterday he had not been aware until recently that enron employees other than fastow had profited from the partnership activity . enron directors had approved fastow ' s management of the partnerships , but fastow quit the partnerships in july and was then replaced as chief financial officer .
enron this week fired treasurer ben glisan and kristina mourdant , an enron division lawyer , who it said had invested in partnerships that were tied to one of the major partnerships headed by fastow . the enron report to the sec describes a central role in these transactions played by michael j . kopper , an associate of fastow who left enron in july to take over fastow ' s financial interests in the partnership , the company said .
enron will hold a conference call next week to discuss what it has uncovered about outside partnership investments .

a year ago , enron corp . chairman kenneth l . lay was on top of the energy world . as a leading fund - raiser , contributor and energy advisor to the bush administration , he played a key role in shaping the new president ' s energy policy . as head of the world ' s largest energy trading company , he had an enormous influence on the price of energy in california and across the nation . enron ' s highflying stock helped him cash out $ 123 million in stock options last year alone .
on friday , with enron being saved from financial collapse by agreeing to be acquired by rival dynegy inc . , lay ' s career and reputation are in shambles . under the merger , he will be stripped of a management job . his integrity is tattered , with enron ' s controversial financial dealings under federal investigation . enron investors and employees are chagrined and outraged because the company ' s stock lost 80 % of its value in recent weeks .
the rapid rise and fall of lay , 58 , is a story of how a brilliant man with innovative ideas and a grand scheme to transform the world ' s energy markets was overcome with arrogance , associates and critics say . under lay , enron stretched the limits of the law and took risks that nearly caused its financial collapse , they say . that in turn could have resulted in a widespread disruption in energy supplies .
"" enron ' s behavior casts doubt on the integrity of our financial markets . it is a very serious matter , "" said edward r . muller , an energy investor and former president of edison international ' s mission energy subsidiary .
"" nobody denies he ' s smart , but it ' s a question of integrity , "" said raymond plank , chief executive of apache corp . and an associate of lay ' s in houston ' s vibrant oil and gas industry .
lay and longtime partner jeffrey k . skilling , who served briefly as enron ' s chief executive before resigning abruptly in august , rose to prominence in the last decade through the use of innovative financial techniques designed to exploit a reduction in government regulation of energy .
lay transformed world energy industries through his vision of new , market - driven ways to finance natural gas and electricity production and transmission .
the financial markets that lay and his enron associates created had an enormous effect on california ' s disastrous experiment in electricity deregulation . critics say his influence was excessive and misguided .
"" ken lay was a mystic , "" said state sen . steve peace ( d - el cajon ) , an outspoken critic of enron . "" whatever he said had to make sense because he was ken lay . it was hero worship . many of the people working as economists at the federal energy regulatory commission worshiped ken lay . as a consequence , the things enron promoted and pushed for were never challenged , intellectually and otherwise . ""
lay , who has a doctorate in economics , had modest beginnings as the son of a poor country preacher who did farm labor on the side to raise money for his children ' s education . in the navy in the late 1960 s , lay was assigned to the defense department because of his economic acumen . "" he allocated pentagon dollars more efficiently in purchasing for the military , "" said mark palmer , chief spokesman for enron .
lay worked for exxon and other energy firms in the 1970 s , amid soaring oil prices , gasoline shortages and still - regulated natural gas . he headed houston natural gas , a predecessor firm of enron , in the 1980 s as falling prices for oil and natural gas presented grave problems for houston ' s energy industries .
when the federal government allowed pipelines to carry the gas of any producer , lay turned enron into a foremost firm in the new , deregulated industry . still , enron almost went bankrupt in the late 1980 s , with natural gas in oversupply and prices falling .

power play / enron had been a political heavyweight / critics decried influence of ken lay in white house

washington - until a few weeks ago , enron corp . was the star of the washington lobbyist corps .
enron chairman ken lay was known to have the ear of his longtime friend and political ally president bush .
vice president dick cheney had unveiled a national energy strategy very much to enron ' s liking , while one of the company ' s favorite electricity regulators , texas ' pat wood iii , had been installed as the new head of the federal energy regulatory commission .
critics feared the houston - based energy and trading giant exerted far too much influence , both in congress and in the bush white house .
now , after the company ' s implosion , enron ' s legendary political might is evaporating as well , political observers say .
"" just a matter of weeks or months ago , enron was still the 800 - pound gorilla , "" said steven weiss , a spokesman for the washington - based center for responsive politics , a political watchdog group . "" it was getting into any meeting it wanted to .
"" relationships are still existent , and bush is unlikely to completely ignore ken lay . but one would have to think the amount of influence that ken lay could exert now pales in comparison to the influence he could have exerted just a month or more ago . ""
now that dynegy has agreed to take over enron , the companies ' role in government will be determined by chuck watson , dynegy ' s chief executive officer .
while enron has been such a player in washington , dynegy is less known inside the capital beltway . but that ' s not to say dynegy has no political pull on capitol hill .
"" ken lay certainly can get meetings with senators , but so can chuck watson , "" a senate staffer said .
while dynegy may be attracted to enron ' s energy trading whiz , the company may be desirous of enron ' s political expertise as well . while watson has had a presence on the national stage , his role in houston ' s stadium votes shows he is hardly allergic to politics .
enron ' s recent troubles , however , may leave a stain . with the securities and exchange commission conducting an investigation into some of the company ' s business dealings , many politicians are likely to be wary .
"" politicians , perhaps better than anyone else , can smell a rotten egg , "" weiss said . "" who would want it reported in the newspaper that they are associated with a company that is under investigation ? ""
enron ' s lobbyist in washington , linda robertson , could not be reached for comment .
a setback among washington ' s elite would be a novel experience for lay and other enron officials . in a city where access is everything , lay has proved - time and again - his political savvy .
a one - time energy policy - maker for richard nixon , lay successfully championed deregulation of the natural gas pipeline industry and has led the effort to open up the electricity markets as well .
a republican , lay served as co - chair of the host committee for the gop ' s national convention in houston in 1992 , when his friend george bush the elder was nominated for a second term . and yet there was lay a few years later , playing golf with the elder bush ' s political nemesis , bill clinton , and advising the democratic administration on energy .
the company has excelled at snatching up political heavyweights as they leave public office . enron has attracted the likes of former secretary of state james baker iii and one - time clinton white house chief of staff thomas "" mack "" mclarty .
enron ' s stable of political lobbyists became a who ' s who of washington insiders , from former christian coalition head ralph reed to one - time energy regulatory commission chairwoman elizabeth "" betsy "" moler .
and by all accounts , enron - and lay especially - rank among the most munificent contributors to george w . bush ' s political career . lay ' s name was mentioned repeatedly as bush drew up his cabinet , and while he did not join the government , he played a role in helping craft bush ' s energy strategy .
lay and other enron officials spent $ 2 . 1 million lobbying congress and the white house last year , the center for responsive politics reported .
in fact , 71 senators and 188 house members have received contributions from lay and other enron officials , the watchdog group found .
questions about lay ' s influence over the federal energy regulatory commission sparked an investigation last summer by congress ' general accounting office .
curt hebert , then the commission chairman , accused lay of trying to prod him into changing his position on an issue of key concern to enron , open access by independent electricity generators to the power lines owned by utilities , in exchange for lay ' s political support .
the gao found no evidence of wrongdoing by either party . three months after the dispute became public , hebert resigned from the commission . he was succeeded by wood , whom enron officials had championed as "" smart , hard - working , fair . ""
just one month ago , enron ' s political muscle appeared undiminished . enron held a conference in washington on energy policy during the first week of october , attracting the likes of wood , senate energy committee chairman jeff bingaman , d - n . m . , and former energy department secretary james schlesinger .
since the start of the company ' s free - fall , enron officials have been less on capitol hill , although that may have merely reflected the city ' s preoccupation with the war on terrorism and the anthrax scare .

power play / sale suddenly switches office outlook downtown

the sale of enron corp . is going to punish houston ' s downtown office market - emptying more office space at a time when several buildings are going up .
enron and its purchaser , dynegy , are both hefty users of downtown office space , and with staff cutbacks likely , they will need a lot less of it .
enron ' s 40 - story office tower , which is under construction on smith street , is expected to be completed next year .
"" if they do go through with the deal , that building is not going to be the enron building . it ' s going to become the dynegy building , "" said office broker sanford criner of the trione & gordon realty firm .
dynegy , which leases 700 , 000 square feet in the wells fargo plaza at 1000 louisiana , would jump at the chance to operate in the new trading floors at the new enron center south , according to a number of downtown office brokers .
"" there ' s no question dynegy has been looking to get a major league trading floor for a long time , "" criner said . "" they definitely covet the enron trading floor . ""
the new 1 . 2 million - square - foot enron tower is a palace of energy trading technology with miles of telecommunications cable running throughout .
the building ' s matching pair of sweeping staircases were intended to lead to the corporate dens of enron chairman ken lay and former ceo jeff skilling but probably will be used by dynegy chairman chuck watson .
john sousa , a spokesman for dynegy , said thursday that the firm ' s current wells fargo space is good and it was too soon to speculate about things like office space .
"" we ' re satisfied with our current location , "" sousa said .
a number of office brokers , however , suggest dynegy would move over to the enron building and attempt to sublease at least some of the space in wells fargo plaza .
enron ' s importance to the houston office market extends beyond the new building . the company occupies about 3 million of the 42 million square feet of office space available downtown , if every small building is counted .
enron occupies its existing 1 . 25 million - square - foot headquarters building at 1400 smith , 500 , 000 square feet of space in three allen center , 60 , 000 square feet in the 500 jefferson building , and 40 , 000 square feet in the 600 jefferson building .
enron has already moved a few employees into its new building , which had been slated to be fully occupied by next summer .
"" this has some real implications , "" said george carpenter of carpenter realty . "" who knows , when the dust settles , where this thing is heading ? ""
trizechahn , which owns the cullen center and allen center properties , had been expecting enron to move out of at least a portion of those buildings when the new enron center south building was complete .
"" we ' re bullish on houston , "" said trizechahn spokesman rick matthews . "" it ' s likely to remain a core market for us . ""
enron ' s shrinkage will come on top of several other moves that will empty downtown office space .
"" it ' s going to be a blood bath next year , "" said one houston office broker who asked that his name not be used .
about 500 , 000 square feet of space will become vacant next year in the chevron tower , according to trione & gordon . a number of chevron employees will be moving into the texaco heritage plaza building as a result of the chevron and texaco merger .
halliburton , another huge downtown office tenant , will be moving out of downtown to new buildings in the westchase area in the next few years , leaving behind a large hole of vacant space at 601 jefferson .
while the demand for office space is beginning to fall , the supply is about to increase .
the 5 houston center , a 27 - story structure that will be complete next year , will open with a significant number of signed tenants . but as major corporate tenants such as ernst & young , jenkens & gilchrist and jackson walker move into the building , they will leave behind vacant space in others .
century development ' s 1000 main building is scheduled to be finished in 2003 . the 783 , 000 - square - foot project , which will have reliant resources as its main tenant , still has more than 200 , 000 square feet of space to lease , according to trione photos : 2 . enron employees kept their cell phones in use outside the company ' s downtown offices friday afternoon . dynegy ' s purchase of enron deals a blow to the city ' s office space market . enron ' s shrinkage will come on top of several other moves that will empty downtown office space ( p . 4 )

baseball history is written fast these days .
as enron corp . , the massive houston energy - trading company , is to be bought out by dynegy , the name enron field may go with it .
enron paid big money - $ 100 million - to put its name on the retractable - roof stadium downtown . it cost a lot to get the name , but it gave enron a lot of marketing firepower and put the company ' s name on the lips of millions of astros fans .
if dynegy completes the acquisition of enron corp . as expected , dynegy also may get the naming rights to the astros ' stadium .
with the name "" enron "" fading in the merger , it appears possible the 42 , 000 - seat baseball stadium would take the dynegy name .
"" if they do something with the company , that name goes with it , "" said pam gardner , president of business operations for the houston astros .
dynegy chairman chuck watson said friday that no decision has been made about renaming the baseball stadium .
however , dynegy did register the domain name dynegyfield . com with verisign , an internet domain name registrar , on thursday .
enron field would not be the first sports facility to undergo a name change .
the compaq center , home of the houston rockets , took the compaq name in 1997 after being called the summit for many years . and the name may be up in the air again as compaq computer corp . contemplates a merger with hewlett - packard .
the stadium for the st . louis rams football team was renamed dome at americas center , after american airlines bought former namesake twa airlines .
"" it ' s not catastrophic if you have to change the name of the arena , "" said dean bonham of bonham group , a sports marketing consulting firm .
sometimes trying to change the name of a stadium can be hard , said kurt hunzeker , editor of team marketing report , a sports business newsletter . the original name for a stadium can be adopted into fan ' s vocabulary , and the secondary names for stadiums don ' t always stick .
many baseball fans in cincinnati have had a hard time adjusting to calling riverfront stadium by its new name of cinergy field , hunzeker said .
sometimes the media refuse to cooperate with the name changes because of tradition or a simple refusal to give into commercialism . the denver post , for example , has refused to adopt the new name of invesco field at mile high stadium .
the deal for a new football stadium for the houston texans is similar to the arrangement with enron field , said steve patterson , senior vice president of the texans .
the texans ' field will be called reliant stadium . if reliant energy is bought out by another company , however , the acquiring company will have the right to change the name of the stadium , patterson said .

executives at royal bank of scotland are among those keeping their fingers crossed that the urgent talks to save the debt - stricken energy trading group enron are successful .
in recent days it has emerged that britain ' s second biggest bank by market capitalisation is a lender to the us group .
at the moment it is not clear how much money the edinburgh bank has lent to enron and whether any of it is secured , but speculation in the market place suggests that the figure could run into millions . it seems rbos was involved in one of the credit facilities arranged for enron , which needs billions of dollars of new money to keep it afloat .
royal bank was yesterday keeping very quiet about the size of the exposure , but worries about the enron situation were enough to push the shares down 44 p to pounds 16 . 70 on a bad day for the banking sector . elsewhere , barclays fell 88 p to pounds 21 . 12 , hsbc lost 9 . 5 p to 792 . 5 p , and lloyds tsb dipped 17 . 5 p to 713 p as investors decided it was time to take some profits .
on the other side of atlantic , enron was locked in talks with rival dynegy over a $ 7 bn ( pounds 4 . 81 bn ) rescue takeover .
with wall street giving up strong gains overnight , as investors decided to book profits after the recent strong run , london ' s top stocks started the day on the back foot . leading shares then trimmed a 50 - point deficit as buyers emerged for heavyweight oil stocks shell , 6 p higher at 514 . 5 p , and bp , 9 p stronger at 565 p after saudi arabia suggested the mood was shifting towards a production cut of 1 . 5 m barrels at next week ' s opec meeting . news that russian oil companies are considering a cut also helped .
that was as good as it got . with wall street failing to provide a lead , the ftse 100 drifted back , eventually closing 33 . 9 points lower at 5 , 244 . 2 . however , dealers were not too downhearted by the performance , pointing to the index ' s 115 - point advance over the week .
cash rich cable & wireless took the ftse 100 ' s wooden spoon , sliding 18 . 25 p to 330 p with dealers attributing its weakness to the re - emergence of talk that it is poised to make a big acquisition . opinion was divided over the potential target . most dealers plumped for colt telecom , which has been linked with c & w in recent weeks . sure enough the shares responded , ending the day 10 . 5 p better at 158 p .
others reckoned c & w had its eye on energis and had approached 30 % shareholder national grid with a view to buying its stake . whatever the truth of that rumour , analysts think energis would be a better bolt - on acquisition for c & w than colt . energis shares eased a penny to 89 p .
invensys , the industrial controls group , firmed 4 . 25 p to 78 . 75 p on hopes that a positive outlook statement will accompany thursday ' s interim results . the figures will also provide analysts with their first chance to quiz new chief executive rick haythornthwaite on his plans to turn around the heavily indebted company .
among the mid caps , carphone warehouse underperformed , falling 2 . 5 p to 109 p , as worries resurfaced about the demand for mobile phones in the christmas trading period .
joint broker csfb caused the trouble . with the outlook uncertain csfb said it had taken the precaution of lowering its pretax profits forecast to a "" worst case scenario "" pounds 55 m . its previous estimate was pounds 67 . 3 m . csfb tried play down the significance of the downgrade , arguing that carphone was likely to outperform its rivals in the next month , but many traders interpreted it as an attempt to lower the city ' s expectations .
furniture group mfi was heading in the other direction , improving 10 . 5 p to 130 p after house broker deutsche bank raised hopes that wednesday ' s trading update could impress . the german investment bank believes business has been good at mfi in recent months and the company is on course to meet its pretax profit forecast of pounds 63 . 5 m .
in an otherwise dull tech sector , autonomy , the intelligent software group advanced 14 . 75 p to 313 p . traders heard talk that the company had secured a couple of big contracts that were put on hold after september ' s terrorist attacks .
there was also a flurry of interest in debenhams , the department store group , on speculation that the company will be tipped in a weekend newspaper . the shares finished 23 p higher at 395 p .
in the smaller companies world , retail investors were chasing redbus interhouse , the web - hosting company run by john porter , the multi - millionaire tesco heir and son of dame shirley porter .
dealers said the investors were betting that monday ' s third quarter figures would top expectations . given the over capacity in the web - hosting market and the fact redbus admitted with interim results in september that demand had fallen , most traders took the view that this was a bold and potentially foolhardy gamble .
elsewhere , those retail investors suckered into character group , the toy and games maker , when its shares hit 30 p late on thursday were nursing losses .
before the market opened , the company said that while one of its division produced a range of harry potter gift products it was not an official potter licensee . character , which had almost doubled in the previous session , shed 6 . 75 p to 24 . 25 p .
there was also some pain for shareholders of brammer , the industrial services group , which fell 61 . 5 p to 256 p after warning full - year pretax profits would be 25 % lower than last year .
engineering group senior gained 0 . 25 p to 29 . 5 p after a stock overhang was cleared . traders believe the shares could enjoy a good run next week , especially as bid rumours are floating around .

enron , the troubled us energy company with close ties to president bush , was yesterday bought for $ 9 . 5 billion ( pounds 6 . 5 billion ) by its smaller rival dynegy .
the move brings to a close one of the most spectacular wall street downfalls of recent years . shareholders in enron , who have seen more than $ 60 billion wiped off the value of the company this year , will get about 0 . 27 of a dynegy share for every share they own in enron , valuing the deal at $ 10 . 41 per enron share .
the deal comes amid a securities & exchange commission investigation into enron ' s controversial business practices . the struggling company also admitted on thursday that it had overstated its profits by nearly $ 586 million and understated its debt by $ 2 . 6 billion over the past four years .
as part of the deal , chevrontexaco , which owns 27 per cent of dynegy , will invest $ 2 . 5 billion in the merged company . shares of dynegy gained $ 2 . 26 to close at $ 38 . 76 . enron shares rose 22 cents to $ 8 . 63 . the announcement on the merger of the two houston - based companies came after the us markets closed .
before the deal was announced , enron saw its credit rating cut by moody ' s to a notch above "" junk "" status . meanwhile , enron ' s exit from a $ 2 . 9 billion power plant project in india was blocked by the bombay high court .
fears also heightened yesterday that us energy traders were beginning to bypass enron ' s internet - based energy trading systems because of concern over the company ' s ability to settle transactions and pay back collateral . so far , enron ' s trading operations have remained immune from the disasters to hit the company on wall street .
the past few weeks have seen the departure of enron ' s finance director , andrew fastow , and its treasurer , ben glisan . the company ' s chief executive , jeffrey skilling , resigned in august .
however , some analysts expressed scepticism at the merger . carole coale , an analyst with prudential securities , said she was puzzled as to "" why dynegy ' s management would want to take on the uncertainties and potential liabilities associated with a merger with enron "" .
enron is america ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and one of the country ' s ten largest companies with revenues last year of more than $ 100 billion .

up to 4 , 000 uk jobs are at risk as us energy group enron seeks a 5 . 5 bn rescue from rival dynegy . enron owns wessex water , two power plants on teeside and runs the world ' s biggest energy - trading operation . those are the jobs believed to be most at risk .
us regulators are investigating off - balance sheet deals allegedly struck by former finance director andrew fastow , who has since left the company .
enron ' s managing director and chief counsel were sacked earlier this week for their roles in the affair . enron took a 685 m charge , prompting a 90 pc fall in its share price . this week , it restated four - year profits down by 22 pc to 405 m .
rating agency moody ' s downgraded enron ' s debt to its lowest investment grade , warning another cut could follow .

dynegy to get prime downtown real estate in enron deal

houston ( ap ) - enron corp . chairman kenneth lay envisioned the four trading floors within his company ' s newly constructed silver glass tower - that was to be its new world headquarters - as an energy trading center much like the chicago mercantile exchange .
"" they are pretty spectacular , "" enron spokeswoman karen denne said of the trading floors following the announcement of dynegy inc . ' s plans to buy enron for about $ 8 billion in stock late friday . "" it is a huge state - of - the - art trading floor . they are really neat . ""
but the trading platforms likely won ' t be enron ' s for long .
if the proposed deal between the two houston - based energy trading companies is approved , the $ 200 million , 40 - story building will be among dynegy ' s new assets in the purchase of its much larger rival . the ornate building , complete with metal sunshades and fins that deflect the sun and lower energy costs , is scheduled for completion sometime next summer .
"" the last three weeks haven ' t been a whole lot of fun , "" lay said during a press conference about the merger friday at dynegy ' s headquarters just a few blocks away from where an oval shaped skybridge encircles smith street .
the enclosed , air conditioned bridge connects what was to be enron ' s new headquarters with its current building on the opposite side of the street .
enron had long - term plans to complete its urban campus with a third tower after building a second tower in 1999 , the first major office building project in downtown houston in more than a decade .
lay and his former chief executive officer , jeff skilling , were to have seventh - floor offices overlooking the trading floors . two curved grand stairways connect the offices to the floors below .
but enron ' s future started changing shortly after skilling ' s surprise resignation in august .
last month enron reported major losses in third quarter earnings . the company ' s stock then tumbled 80 percent in the past three weeks as investors grew increasingly concerned that serious financial problems were being hidden from shareholders through business partnerships now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission .
a day after lay expressed his confidence in his chief financial officer andrew fastow , who managed those partnerships , fastow was ousted in an attempt to regain investor confidence .
it didn ' t work , and skilling has since been called to testify before the sec about the partnerships .
then dynegy stepped in , and one houston company came to the rescue of another , prudential securities inc . analyst carol coale said .
"" enron needed dynegy . they needed a rescuer , "" coale said . "" the run on enron stock was similar to a run on a bank . once things start to capitulate it can run right down into liquidity . ""
while dynegy says its too early to discuss layoffs , what happens to the name of the houston astros ' enron field or the future uses for enron ' s buildings , university of houston economist barton smith doubted the company will let the prime real estate go unused .
"" at one time ken lay and his family had a vision of houston having an energy exchange and i think that vision is going to continue , "" smith said . "" this brings dynegy , which was a relatively small player , in as a pretty strong force . ""
smith said reductions in philanthropic giving are likely . enron has contributed to many texas schools , including the university of houston , rice university , the university of texas and southern methodist university .
while the company ' s philanthropy has gained fans in texas , many in california , plagued by power shortages earlier this year , still resent enron for its outspoken support of deregulation .
"" the principles of karma seem to be working here , "" said harvey rosenfield , founder of a california consumer advocacy group . "" here enron was one of the chief proponents of deregulation and took advantage of it and benefitted enormously and now is reaping the consequences . ""
texas economists say ripple effects of the dynegy - enron merger on houston ' s economy will be minimal , even if the combination forces layoffs .
"" there are some recessionary pressures going on in the united states , but houston is probably in a better position than any city i know of to dampen those pressures , "" said mark baxter , director of the maguire energy institute at southern methodist university . "" the houston market is unique in that aspect . ""
but michelle michot foss , director of the energy institute at the university of houston , said the nation ' s fourth - largest city isn ' t immune to a weakening national economy .
"" we do have a three - pronged problem in town , which is continental , compaq and enron , "" she said . "" but there is no way this is as bad as ( the oil bust years of ) 1986 and 1987 . ""
houston - based continental airlines has cut 12 , 000 jobs and reduced its flight schedule in the wake of sept . 11 ' s attacks in new york , washington d . c . and pennsylvania . meanwhile , hewlett - packard is attempting to buy compaq , also based in houston , which could result in additional layoffs from the computer maker .
"" the whole debacle with enron has been very unfortunate , "" smith said . "" enron , in some ways , was the icon of houston with the merger of compaq . now it looks as if it ' s going to be dynegy . ""

enron india pwr unit sale faces review after dynegy deal
11 / 10 / 2001
dow jones energy service
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones tata power co . ltd . ( p . tpw ) and bses ltd . ( p . bsx ) - heavyweights in the indian power sector .
enron wants to sell its controlling equity stake in the $ 2 . 9 billion project due to payment defaults by the plant ' s sole customer - the maharashtra state electricity board - and the indian federal government ' s failure to honor payment guarantees .
a bombay - based analyst with a leading indian brokerage agreed that the issues surrounding the sale of enron ' s stake in the dpc would have to reevaluated "" from scratch . ""
"" some post - takeover ' cleaning - up ' in the merged entity will be expected . dynegy really need to see what their energy interests are and whether india will figure in them , "" the analyst said .
the analyst doubted dynegy would take over enron ' s stake in the dpc itself in an attempt to revive it . "" prima facie , it appears unlikely . it ( dynegy ) has not really got into independent power projects outside the u . s . , "" the analyst said .
indian media reports over the past two months have said enron wants $ 1 billion for its stake in dabhol .
however , commentators say enron may have to sell at a discount given the company ' s deepening financial woes . a discounted sale would remain the case for dynegy "" without a doubt "" post - takeover , the analyst said .
dpc officials were unavailable for comment at the time of writing .
indian banking executives remained tight - lipped on the outcome of the singapore talks , but described negotiations as "" very fruitful "" and "" successful . ""
"" there was full cooperation from all sides . certainly , we have moved forward , but there ' s no decision ( on a buyer for enron ' s stake ) as yet , "" said idbi executive director a . k . doda . "" i ' m hopeful if we go through these routes it ' ll lead somewhere . ""
the idbi ' s vora said all concerned parties had "" no immediate "" plans to hold any further talks .
asked whether tata power was the frontrunner , as many analysts believe , doda said : "" that ' s their guess . ""
analysts said tata power and bses wouldn ' t necessarily be out of the running after the dynegy - enron merger . "" i think dynegy will be relatively more willing to diversify dpc and that wouldn ' t change the equation vis - a - vis tata and bses , "" he said . "" overall , it ' s positive . ""
dabhol is india ' s largest single foreign investment . mseb holds a 15 % stake , while general electric co . ( ge ) and bechtel ( x . btl ) own 10 % each .
dpc ' s domestic lenders include icici ltd . ( p . icc ) , industrial development bank of india ( p . idb ) , ifci ltd . ( p . ici ) and state bank of india ( p . sbi ) .
loans by foreign lenders , including abn amro , bank of america corp . and citigroup inc . , however , are backed by government guarantees , while domestic lenders ' loans are not .

singapore ( ap ) - talks in singapore to assess possible buyers for u . s . - based enron corp . ' s controlling stake in the troubled indian dabhol power company have been extended into an unscheduled third day , an indian banking executive involved in the negotiations said saturday .
the two - day closed - door meeting - originally scheduled to wrap up friday - is focusing on two potential buyers of houston - based enron ' s 65 percent stake in the power company .
tata power co . and bses ltd . - two of india ' s largest private power companies - are the only contenders vying to buy enron ' s stake in dabhol .
"" talks will carry on today ( saturday ) , "" said a . k . doda , executive director of the industrial development bank of india . "" it ' s going to take a little more time . ""
senior indian banking sources told dow jones newswire that the talks are "" intense , "" but "" positive , "" with negotiations continuing past midnight local time .
dabhol managing director k . wade cline , officials from both prospective buyers and a consortium of indian lenders to the dabhol project are involved in the talks .
the dabhol power company owns a 2 , 184 megawatt power plant in the western indian state of maharashtra . the company is embroiled in a bitter power supply dispute with the state government over allegedly "" unaffordable "" power tariffs .
enron wants to sell its controlling equity stake in the dlrs 2 . 9 billion project due to payment defaults by the plant ' s sole customer - the maharashtra state electricity board - and the indian federal government ' s failure to honor payment guarantees .
dabhol is india ' s biggest - ever single foreign investment . the maharashtra state electricity board holds a 15 percent stake , while general electric co . and bechtel group inc . own 10 percent each .
domestic lenders have provided dlrs 1 . 4 billion of the project ' s total projected cost of dlrs 2 . 9 billion .
loans by foreign lenders , including abn amro , bank of america corp . and citigroup inc . are backed by government guarantees .

all eyes in electric industry on texas as deregulation nears
by david koenig
ap business writer
11 / 10 / 2001
associated press newswires
copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved .
dallas ( ap ) - electric deregulation was a fabulous failure in california , resulting in skyrocketing rates , accusations of price - gouging and fears of widespread power blackouts .
the flop has made consumers elsewhere suspicious about giving up their regulated monopoly utilities for competition among power companies .
regulators and industry officials are turning their attention to texas , where deregulation is scheduled to begin jan . 1 after a rocky test program .
"" people are looking to texas as the next iteration of retail competition . a lot of states have pulled back after the california experience , "" says brett perlman , a member of the public utility commission . "" if texas is successful , texas will become the model for the nation . ""
ken malloy , president of a pro - deregulation think tank called the center for the advancement of energy markets , called texas the state to watch .
"" california obviously created a domino effect , "" leading other states to delay deregulation , malloy said . "" a lot of people are placing a lot of hope on texas . ""
texas officials say that unlike california , which must import much of its power , texas imports little and has built more than 50 new power plants since 1995 , providing an important cushion .
texas also made it easier for power generators and resellers to negotiate long - term contracts , which officials say will help lock in lower prices . and texas provides more - digestible price information , making it easier for consumers to comparison - shop , they say .
california officials warn that texans may be a little too smug .
they spot trouble already in texas , including california - style price spikes in some spot markets for electricity - a clear sign , they say , that power companies are learning how to maximize profits by forcing prices up .
"" there are things that can be done by people who own the power to create a shortage , and if they see an opportunity to make money doing that they will , "" said john rozsa , an aide to state sen . steve peace , who was heavily involved in california ' s deregulation debate .
california officials accuse the power companies - many of them texas - based - of withholding supplies or clogging transmission lines to drive prices higher . they say the same techniques could be used in texas .
supporters and opponents of deregulation do agree that the stakes will be high in texas for power companies and consumers .
"" if the wheels fall off , it would be hard to put it back together , "" says bob manning , an executive with san antonio - based h - e - b grocery co . , which hopes to cut its $ 40 million annual electricity bill through deregulation by at least 6 percent .
the idea behind electric deregulation is simple and powerful . instead of forcing residents and businesses to buy their power from a monopoly such as txu electric or reliant , let them choose among several competing companies .
in theory , competition should cause prices to fall , as it did for air travel and long - distance phone service . that ' s what the texas legislature thought when it voted in 1999 to let utility customers pick a new power company beginning jan . 1 , 2002 .
power traders led by enron corp . lobbied heavily for deregulation , figuring they could profit by gaining a chunk of the utilities ' business even though enron produces little power itself .
to prepare for deregulation , the legislature approved a seven - month pilot program in which a few commercial and residential customers would be able to switch . soon , glaring problems emerged .
the trial program was delayed three times . when it finally began this summer , the state ' s main power grid struggled to switch customers to their new power company . prices for backup power used on hot summer days temporarily jumped 100 - fold .
through it all , the public utility commission and the power companies and their allies have insisted the pilot program was serving its purpose of highlighting potential problems .
"" anytime you buy a new home there are a whole bunch of things you need to get fixed before you move in , "" perlman said this week . "" we ' re going down that punch list , and i think we ' ll be ready on jan . 1 . ""
the unresolved issues , he said , include how utilities such as txu and reliant will pass on the cost of fuel to their customers , who were guaranteed a 6 percent rate cut on jan . 1 .
in addition to the technical setbacks , deregulation suffered a blow when shell energy , a unit of the anglo - dutch energy giant , pulled out of texas after signing up 40 , 000 customers . suddenly one of the biggest players and a potent competitor to txu and reliant had vanished .
shell has said that doing business in texas became uneconomical after other states delayed deregulation .
"" that was a bit bizarre , because they had spent a lot of money to attract customers , "" said brian lloyd , a top puc official on pricing issues . "" but if they don ' t want to be here , we don ' t want them . ""
lloyd and other puc officials are confident that as deregulation catches on , other power companies will move in to texas , ensuring strong competition .
already , however , deregulation will be delayed beyond jan . 1 because of a lack of competition and questions about power - transmission in a section of southeast texas served by entergy corp . and in a stretch of northeast texas served by southwestern electric power co .
last month , consumers union , aarp and other groups asked the puc to delay competition everywhere in texas because of computer glitches and billing problems during the pilot program .
deregulation advocates worry that residential customers will simply stay with their old electric utility , causing new competitors to fail .
the puc is likely to push ahead after receiving a final round of comments next week from electric companies and officials of the main power grid , called the electric reliability council of texas , or ercot .
along with the power traders , large commercial customers - like the h - e - b grocery chain - figure to be winners .
"" a grocery store is an energy hog , "" manning said . "" we have a lot of refrigerators that run 24 hours a day , 365 days a year . we help ( the power companies ' ) bottom line . ""
perlman , the puc member , predicted deregulation will start on time but said that making it trouble - free was the most important goal to build consumer confidence .
"" a year from now , no one will remember whether the market opened on jan . 1 or jan . 15 or march 15 , "" he said .

enron says it ' s too soon to quantify u . k . job cuts ( updatel )
2001 - 11 - 10 07 : 24 ( new york )
enron says it ' s too soon to quantify u . k . job cuts ( updatel )
( adds detail on u . k . operations , dynegy transaction , lenders ,
from fifth paragraph . )
london , nov . 10 ( bloomberg ) - - dynegy inc . ' s $ 23 billion
acquisition of enron corp . is at too early a stage for either
company to know how many u . k . jobs will be eliminated , an enron
spokesman said , after a newspaper reported 4 , 000 are at risk .
dynegy ' s acquisition of the biggest energy trader , announced
yesterday , ` ` is still a long way off from closing , ' ' said enron
spokesman alex parsons . ` ` it ' s too early to know what the impact
will be on u . k . jobs , ' ' he said .
the daily mail newspaper , which didn ' t cite sources , said
today that 4 , 000 jobs are at risk , mainly at enron ' s wessex water
unit , in southwest england , two power plants on teeside , in
northeast england , and at its energy trading operation . it employs
5 , 400 people in europe , mostly in the u . k . , said parsons .
dynegy said yesterday it would save as much as $ 500 million a
year by ` ` winding down ' ' enron ' s business outside of trading and
pipelines and cutting costs .
enron decided to sell after its shares plunged 90 percent
this year amid investors ' concerns about the accuracy of its
financial statements . the company had said in october it planned
to eliminate as many as 500 jobs in europe , or almost as much as
10 percent of the workforce there , to reduce costs .
offset risk
the company , which owns generation in the u . k . to offset risk
in its power trading operations , said in august two workers died
and two others were seriously injured in an explosion and fire at
teeside power station , which it operates and partly owns .
enron owns wessex water as part of its azurix water unit . it
spent $ 2 . 8 billion in 1998 for wessex , from which azurix emerged .
enron sold azurix shares to the public in 1999 , and then bought
back the company this year after the unit failed in its strategy
of buying up water companies and winning large projects .
in august , enron agreed to sell azurix ' s north american
business to american water works inc . for $ 150 million .
the dynegy transaction is expected to close in 2002 ' s third
quarter . the new company will have $ 90 billion in assets , dynegy
said . dynegy ' s stockholders , including chevrontexaco , will have 64
percent of the new company . enron ' s holders will own the rest .
the merger will face opposition from consumer groups ,
especially in california , where energy traders such as dynegy and
enron were blamed for soaring electricity prices that left the
state ' s biggest utility bankrupt and the second - largest fighting
for a government bailout .
other companies may yet be caught in the fallout from enron ' s
situation . royal bank of scotland group plc is a lender to enron ,
the guardian newspaper reported today , without citing sources .
it ' s unclear how much the u . k . ' s no . 3 bank by assets lent
enron , though it may be as high as several million pounds , the
paper said . it ' s not clear if the loans are secured , it said .
royal bank was involved in setting up a credit facility for enron ,
the newspaper said , adding this helped push down the company ' s
share price by 2 . 6 percent yesterday .

dynegy to buy enron for $ 23 billion in stock , debt ( update 9 )
2001 - 11 - 09 23 : 23 ( new york )
dynegy to buy enron for $ 23 billion in stock , debt ( update 9 )
( adds advisers in last paragraph . )
houston , nov . 9 ( bloomberg ) - - dynegy inc . agreed to buy
enron corp . for at least $ 23 billion in stock and assumed debt ,
ending a financial crisis that threatened to bankrupt enron and
disrupt u . s . power and natural - gas markets .
investors will get 0 . 2685 of a dynegy share for each enron
share , or $ 10 . 41 based on dynegy ' s closing price today . the stock
portion of the transaction is valued at $ 8 billion to $ 9 billion ,
dynegy chief financial officer robert doty said . dynegy said it
will assume about $ 15 billion in enron debt .
enron , the largest energy trader , decided to sell after its
shares plunged 90 percent this year and a federal investigation of
accounting irregularities limited its ability to finance
operations . enron ' s collapse would have caused upheaval in energy
markets , where the company does one - quarter of all gas and power
trades , traders say .
` ` without someone stepping in to play the role enron plays ,
people ( would ) have a difficult time executing transactions , ' '
said daniel gordon , president of allegheny energy inc . ' s trading
unit .
chevrontexaco corp . , the second - biggest u . s . oil company and
owner of 26 percent of dynegy , will provide enron with
$ 1 . 5 billion immediately . chevrontexaco will give dynegy
$ 1 billion after the merger closes .
dynegy chief executive officer charles watson , who led a
company that has put as much emphasis on building power plants as
on energy trading , will take over a larger rival that chairman and
ceo kenneth lay had focused on trading .
earnings reduced
lay ' s strategy boosted enron ' s reported revenue to
$ 100 . 7 billion in 2000 , almost four times dynegy ' s and more than
20 times what enron generated in 1995 . at its peak in december
2000 , enron stock was valued at more than $ 69 billion .
in recent months , enron shares plummeted as investors began
to question the accuracy of enron ' s financial statements , saying
it was unclear whether the company was using affiliated
partnerships to move debt off its books and hide losses .
yesterday the company restated its earnings for the past
four years , lowering them by more than $ 500 million to include
losses from partnerships it once kept off its books . after the
merger announcement , standard & poor ' s investors service said it
may lower dynegy ' s debt rating . it cut enron ' s to ` ` bbb - , ' ' one
notch above junk .
watson , dynegy president stephen bergstrom and cfo doty will
keep their positions at the combined company . greg whalley , the
president and chief operating officer of enron , will be an
executive vice president . lay said he won ' t be an active manager
in the new company . lay has not discussed a severance package with
him , watson said .
$ 200 billion in revenue
dynegy said it will have annual revenue of more than
$ 200 billion , more than 22 , 000 megawatts of electric generating
capacity and 25 , 000 miles of pipeline after the merger . the
company will save as much as $ 500 million a year by ` ` winding
down ' ' enron ' s business outside of trading and pipelines and
cutting costs , dynegy said .
the announcement of the merger came after the close of stock
market trading , though the two companies had acknowledged they
were in talks . shares of dynegy rose $ 2 . 26 , or 6 percent , to
$ 38 . 76 . enron rose 22 cents to $ 8 . 63 . chevrontexaco rose $ 1 . 90 to
$ 89 . 49 . enron ' s 6 . 4 percent bonds , which mature in 2006 , jumped
to about 76 cents on the dollar , up from 69 cents , traders said .
the combination is expected to be ` ` strongly accretive ' ' to
earnings , dynegy said . it projected earnings of $ 3 . 40 to $ 3 . 50 a
share next year . it had been expected to earn $ 2 . 57 , the average
estimate of analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call .
third quarter closing
the transaction is expected to close in 2002 ' s third quarter .
the new company will have $ 90 billion in assets , dynegy said .
dynegy ' s stockholders , including chevrontexaco , will have 64
percent of the new company . enron ' s holders will own the rest .
` ` dynegy is taking out a competitor , acquiring some attractive
assets and they ' re doing it at an incredible price , ' ' said joseph
correnti , an analyst at wayne hummer investments who doesn ' t own
shares of either company . enron will pay a
$ 350 million breakup fee if the transaction collapses .
the two houston - based companies began negotiations a week ago
as it became apparent that enron needed cash to stay in business .
watson said he approached lay .
` ` i simply called ken to see if there was anything we could
do to straighten ' ' out rumors of a cash crunch at enron , watson
said . ` ` that next saturday , ken was gracious enough to invite me
over to his home . ' '
dynegy agreed to the terms after moody ' s investors service
maintained an investment grade rating on enron today , eliminating
a stumbling block in negotiations .
cash crunch
moody ' s announcement removed the threat that a junk rating
would force enron to repay early $ 3 . 3 billion in bonds . enron has
been battling a cash crunch and a loss of investor confidence
because of questions about partnerships started by its senior
executives .
enron fired chief financial officer andrew fastow in october
as a securities and exchange commission investigation focused in
on partnerships he headed and helped create . enron estimated
fastow made $ 30 million through partnerships affiliated with the
company .
the sec began the investigation after enron reduced third -
quarter earnings by more than $ 1 billion and said dealings with
two partnerships had lowered shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion .
` ` clearly , ( the partnerships ) created quite a perception
problem for the company , and maybe more serious problems than
that , ' ' lay said on a conference call after the buyout
announcement . ` ` we ' ll see over time . ' '
california opposition
the merger will face opposition from consumer groups ,
especially in california , where energy traders such as dynegy and
enron were blamed for soaring electricity prices that left the
state ' s biggest utility bankrupt and the second - largest fighting
for a government bailout .
` ` we will petition the state attorney general and federal
authorities to block this merger , ' ' said doug heller of the
california - based foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights .
` ` this would further tighten the grip that the unregulated power
industry has over california , and it ' s the grip of the energy
cartel that has choked california for the last year and a half . ' '
energy trading markets ` ` are relatively fragmented ' ' so there
should be no antitrust problems , even though enron and dynegy are
big companies , said robert burka , a washington - based antitrust
attorney with foley & lardner . ` ` enron may well not be a healthy
company going forward ' ' if the merger isn ' t approved , burka said .
enrononline
the combination of the two companies will leave watson with
control of enrononline , an internet energy and commodities trading
site that has done more than $ 880 billion in trades since it was
created in november 1999 .
` ` it ' s not perfectly capturing the value of enron , but if
you ' re on the board at enron at this point , you take it and move
on , ' ' said correnti of wayne hummer investments .
the total value of the stock portion of the transaction
could rise , depending how many enron shares need to be converted
in the stock swap . an enron spokesman said the company had 913
million shares on a fully diluted basis , though a person familiar
with the talks said enron ' s stock price is so low that many common
share equivalents won ' t be converted , leaving the number at 743
million shares .
lehman brothers inc . is dynegy ' s financial adviser on the
transaction . salomon smith barney inc . and j . p . morgan & co . are
advising enron .

houston ( ap ) - energy marketer dynegy inc . announced friday that it will buy its much larger rival , the once mighty but now troubled enron corp . , for $ 8 billion in stock . dynegy also will assume a hefty $ 15 billion in enron debt .
the announcement came after enron ' s stock price plummeted about 80 percent over the past three weeks because of concerns that the company wasn ' t revealing serious financial problems to shareholders .
under the deal , chevrontexaco corp . , which owns more than a quarter of dynegy , would quickly provide about $ 1 . 5 billion . chevrontexaco also would contribute an additional $ 1 billion upon completion of the deal , the companies said .
"" with its market - making capabilities , earnings power and proven strategic approach to wholesale markets , enron is the ideal strategic partner for dynegy , "" dynegy chairman and chief executive officer chuck watson said in announcing the purchase .
watson made it clear that he would not tolerate the sort of financial practices that prompted explosive disclosures by enron this week - including an admission that more than half a billion dollars in debt had been kept off the company ' s books .
"" as a combined company , we will focus on leveraging our core skill sets and , as always , we will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key priorities , "" watson said .
enron is the country ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas , and the no . 1 wholesale power marketer . the company operates a 25 , 000 - mile gas pipeline system , and also markets and trades metals , paper , coal , chemicals , and fiber - optic bandwidth .
dynegy controls nearly 15 , 000 megawatts of power generating capacity through investments in power projects , and sells the energy in wholesale markets and through utilities .
at a news conference , watson said company officials who negotiated the deal came away convinced that enron was worth buying despite its recent troubles .
"" we looked under the hood and , guess what , it ' s just as strong as we thought it was , "" watson said .
under the terms of the deal , enron shareholders will receive . 2685 dynegy share for each share of enron common stock , valuing each enron share at $ 10 . 41 . enron has about 775 million common shares , said spokeswoman karen denne .
that represents a 21 percent premium above enron ' s closing price of $ 8 . 63 friday on the new york stock exchange - but still just a fraction of their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 87 . dynegy ' s shares climbed $ 2 . 26 , or 6 percent , to close at $ 38 . 76 on the nyse .
in after hours trading on the nyse , enron shares shot up 15 . 6 percent , or $ 1 . 35 , to $ 9 . 98 . dynegy shares were unchanged .
dynegy ' s stockholders will own approximately 64 percent of the new company , with enron ' s stockholders holding the remainder .
the boards of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction , which is expected to close next summer . the deal is expected to save the combined company between $ 400 and $ 500 million annually because of continued elimination of "" non - core "" enron holdings and lower operating costs . watson said it was too soon to say if the deal would result in job cuts . enron has about 20 , 000 employees , while dynegy ' s work force is about 6 , 000 .
watson will remain as chairman and chief executive of the combined company , which will retain the dynegy inc . name . dynegy ' s steve bergstrom will continue as president .
enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay will no longer have a role in day - to - day management of the company , but has been offered a seat on the combined company ' s board and will help shepherd the merger through .
dynegy said that greg whalley , the current president and chief operating officer of enron , will become an executive vice president of the new dynegy . he said the merger sets the best course for enron .
"" few of the options we considered for our core business going forward provided us with the earning potential and immediate synergies that a merger with dynegy could deliver , "" whalley said . "" together with enron ' s recently announced bank commitments , this cash infusion gives enron immediate liquidity , which we believe will enable the company to maintain its investment grade credit rating . ""
the merger was announced a day after enron acknowledged it overstated earnings by about 20 percent over the past four years and kept large amounts of debt off its balance sheets through business partnerships now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission .
analysts said the merger rescues enron , but leaves dynegy in uncharted territory - with the outcome of the sec investigation completely unknown . "" there is still a shroud hanging over enron that now moves over to dynegy , "" said carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities .
early friday , moody ' s investors service downgraded enron ' s debt ratings to one level above junk bond status and said the company ' s long - term debt ratings remain under review for further downgrade .
in an sec filing , enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 "" should not be relied upon "" and that outside businesses run by enron officials during that period should have been included in the company ' s earnings reports .
the revised statements reduced enron ' s profits for those years by $ 586 million , from $ 2 . 89 billion to $ 2 . 31 billion . the revisions also increased the company ' s debt each of the four years , reaching $ 10 . 86 billion - $ 628 million more than previously reported - by the end of 2000 .
keeping the debt off its balance sheets likely ensured enron could maintain a strong credit rating to support expansion of its core businesses - wholesale trading of natural gas and electricity .
but the company ' s stock price started dropping 10 months ago when its high - speed internet unit foundered and enron had trouble collecting money from power customers in india .
the stock price began to free fall after enron announced a $ 618 million third quarter loss , and news of the sec investigation surfaced .
enron responded by firing its chief financial officer and scrambled to get cash and increase credit lines in an attempt to regain investor confidence , but investors dumped enron shares and sent its stock plummeting .
the ousted chief financial officer , andrew fastow , ran some of the partnerships under investigation by the sec .
jeff skilling , enron ' s former chief executive who left in august , has been called to testify before the sec , although it ' s unclear when .

usa : update 3 - dynegy to acquire enron for $ 9 bln .

( adds new material from news conference , new analyst comments )
by andrew kelly
houston , nov . 9 ( reuters ) - dynegy inc . agreed on friday to acquire rival enron corp . for some $ 9 billion in stock , underlining the dramatic reversal of fortunes for the houston - based energy trading giant that was valued last year at nearly $ 80 billion .
enron ' s stock fell sharply in the past month due to investors ' concerns about murky transactions that sparked an investigation by u . s . regulators and damaging downgrades by credit rating agencies .
"" it ' s an unbelievable ending to an unbelievable story , "" said fulcrum global partners analyst michael barbis . "" the company that created the industry is gone - it ' s all dynegy now . ""
the merged company will retain the dynegy name . it will have annual revenues of more than $ 200 billion and assets worth $ 90 billion , including more than 22 , 000 megawatts of electricity generating capacity and 25 , 000 miles of natural gas pipelines .
it will be north america ' s biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity , positions previously held by enron .
dynegy will control the new 14 - member board , holding 11 of its seats , and the top executive positions .
chevrontexaco corp . , a 26 . 5 percent stakeholder in dynegy , will provide an immediate infusion of $ 1 . 5 billion to keep enron ' s core trading operations afloat and a further $ 1 billion when the deal closes . it will get three board seats .
dynegy ' s watson firmly in control
the deal puts chuck watson , dynegy ' s pioneering chairman and chief executive who has long labored under enron ' s shadow , firmly in charge of the new company .
"" it is a great deal for dynegy and , under the circumstances , as a good of a deal as enron could get , "" said ubs warburg analyst ron barone .
watson will remain chairman and chief executive of the merged company , while dynegy ' s president , steve bergstrom , and chief financial officer , rob doty , will retain those positions .
greg whalley , president and chief operating officer of enron , will become an executive vice president and will join watson , bergstrom and doty in the office of the chairman .
barbis said that after enron saw its stock fall 75 percent over the last month , cutting its market capitalization by $ 19 billion , the company was left in a weak negotiating position . "" at the end of the day they had no choice , "" he said .
dynegy will swap 0 . 2685 shares of its own stock for each enron share , valuing houston - based enron at $ 10 . 41 per share , a premium of 21 percent over friday ' s closing price of $ 8 . 63 .
the price is far below a lofty high of $ 90 . 56 set on aug . 23 , 2000 , when enron was riding a wave of investor enthusiasm .
dynegy stockholders will own about 64 percent and enron stockholders will own about 36 percent of the merged company .
regulators probe enron deals
enron had been struggling to overcome a plummeting stock price and credit ratings in the past month following disclosures of off - balance sheet deals now under investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission .
enron chairman and chief executive ken lay told a news conference in houston that he would have preferred enron to retain its independence but that this had become impossible in the face of a "" consistent barrage of really negative articles "" .
"" the last three weeks haven ' t been a whole lot of fun , "" said lay , adding that he had not yet decided whether to take up watson ' s offer of a seat on the merged company ' s board .
watson said the agreement with enron includes "" escape clauses "" that would allow dynegy to back out of the deal if any further undisclosed problems were to emerge , but he said he was confident that this would not happen .
"" you know , we looked under the hood and guess what ? it ' s just as strong as we though it was , "" he said .
watson said he did not expect the merger to run into serious regulatory obstacles .
"" regulatory agencies realize that a speedy resolution is important to keep stability in the u . s . energy market . this has got to be resolved , "" said ubs warburg analyst barone .
dynegy said it expects the new company to earn $ 3 . 40 to $ 3 . 50 per share in 2002 , an increase of 35 percent , or 90 cents to 95 cents per share , for current dynegy shareholders , before taking into account expected synergies and cost savings .
dynegy estimates annual pretax savings of $ 400 million to $ 500 million as a result of the sale or winding down of non - core businesses in the enron portfolio and other measures .
watson said he did not yet know how many jobs might be cut as a result of combining the two companies .
the merger still requires approval by regulators and both sets of shareholders but is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2002 .
lehman brothers was financial advisor to dynegy . j . p . morgan chase and salomon smith barney , a unit of citigroup , were financial advisors to enron .

enron not california ' s largest power supplier , but merger could affect prices

san francisco ( ap ) - when houston - based dynegy inc . announced friday that it had bought enron , its larger rival for $ 7 . 8 billion shares of stock , some energy traders predicted fluctuating power prices in the coming months throughout the west as the market settles into a new hierarchy with one fewer provider .
"" the fragility of the system is such that a small perturbation can turn everything upside down very easily , "" said gary ackerman , executive director of the western power trading forum , of which enron is a member . "" a week ago i don ' t think many people would have even contemplated this . ""
the loss of houston - based enron will "" make prices more jumpy and more uncertain and it ' s going to take the market some time to calm down , "" ackerman said . should the northwest have a chilly winter , prices could spike with fewer sellers in the market , he said .
and that in turn could affect california ' s pocketbook , though the state buys a negligible amount of electricity from enron , said oscar hidalgo , spokesman for the state department of water resources , which buys electricity for the customers of two financially ailing utilities . hidalgo said the state had a long - term contract with enron earlier this year though the marketer opted out of it after a month .
"" they have indicated to us that we were somewhat of a credit risk for them , like many generators at the time , "" hidalgo said .
earlier this year , enron attempted to cancel its contract as electricity and natural gas provider to california ' s two public university systems , which spent more than $ 170 million combined last year on the fuels . it was unclear friday what would happen to those contracts .
enron ' s reach in california goes beyond keeping the lights on .
the state ' s retirement pension fund owns 3 million shares of enron stock - about 1 percent of its total investments - said calpers spokeswoman pat macht . the calpers board will meet next week to discuss the situation , she said .
"" i can only say at this point that we were as surprised and shocked as the rest of the world was about what has been going on there and we ' re assessing our options , "" macht said .
enron corp . ' s outspoken support for deregulation of the country ' s electricity markets sparked resentment in california as rolling blackouts swept through earlier this year , although the energy marketer is not one of california ' s largest power providers .
some felt the financial downfall of the nation ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas and major electricity seller was justified .
"" the principles of karma seem to be working here , "" said harvey rosenfield , founder of the santa monica , calif . - based consumer advocacy group the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights . "" here enron was one of the chief proponents of deregulation and took advantage of it and benefitted enormously and now is reaping the consequences . ""
earlier this year , california attorney general bill lockyer subpoenaed enron ' s electricity trading records as he sought to prove the state was the victim of price gouging which led officials to spend more than $ 9 billion buying electricity for the customers of two financially troubled utilities . enron repeatedly denied all accusations of market manipulation .
enron , the nation ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas and the top wholesale marketer in the united states , had become one of the nation ' s 10 largest companies , recording revenue of $ 100 . 8 billion in 2000 .

dynegy - enron merger could mean name change for enron field

houston ( ap ) - the houston astros ' stadium won ' t be nicknamed "" home run field "" much longer .
houston - based energy marketer dynegy inc . announced friday that it will buy enron corp . , the $ 100 million namesake of the astros ' ballpark . the companies will operate independently until the deal closes , possibly next summer .
the new company will keep dynegy ' s name and lose enron ' s - and houston ' s $ 251 million ballpark could see the same change , astros owner drayton mclane jr . said .
mclane said the team ' s 30 - year naming rights agreement with enron allows another company to give the ballpark a new name in case of a merger . the astros have the right to approve or reject a change .
"" we want to work with ( dynegy chairman and chief executive ) chuck watson and we look forward to working with dynegy , "" mclane said .
watson said the ballpark name wasn ' t an issue as the companies hammered out the merger agreement this week .
"" quite honestly , it has not come up , "" watson said friday . "" this is about two strong companies going forward . it is something we will have to deal with in the months coming up . ""
since opening before the 2000 season , enron field has become known as one of the best parks for hitters in the majors . there have been 496 homers hit in enron the past two years , 19 percent more than in astros road games .
coincidentally , houston ' s other company - named sports facility also is in question . the corporate namesake of the compaq center basketball / hockey arena , compaq computer corp . , is being bought by hewlett - packard co .
enron field wouldn ' t be the first venue to change names because of a merger or other corporate decision by the naming - rights owner .
corestates arena , home to the philadelphia 76 ers and the philadelphia flyers , became first union arena when first union corp . acquired corestates financial corp . in 1998 .
marine midland arena in buffalo , n . y . , became hsbc arena last year because marine midland in 1999 changed its name to hsbc bank usa as part of a global branding strategy .
such changes are inevitable when 61 major league sports facilities bear corporate names in an age of many mergers and acquisitions , said dean bonham of the bonham group in denver , a sports and entertainment marketing firm .
"" mergers and acquisitions had no effect on the sports industry just 10 years ago , "" he said . "" today they can have a significant affect on the community beyond the direct impact on the company itself . ""
enron chairman and chief executive ken lay , who said friday he had been invited to serve on the new company ' s board of directors , helped create enron field before buying its name .
by 1996 mclane had determined it was time to move from the once - futuristic though aging astrodome , and threatened to sell part of the team and move to virginia unless a new ballpark was built in houston .
that year lay put together a consortium that provided a $ 34 . 7 million no - interest loan to buy the land in downtown houston and subsidize the 42 , 000 - seat ballpark ' s construction costs .
enron also manages the ballpark ' s mechanical and electrical equipment and energy services which officials said would earn up to $ 200 million over 30 years . mclane said dynegy likely would continue that deal .

enclosed is a revised copy of the software licence agreement with d - g energy . the earlier version had prices and conditions of use which differed from what had been discussed over the telephone . this version brings into line the terms with what has been agreed upon , and has been given tentative approval by the president of d - g , who i met with last week .
i have highlighed the sections which have changed from the version that you sent out for signature last november .
i assume that the revised document will have to be reviewed by legal again . let me know if i can be of any assistance in this process .

if this deal was zeroed out ( and it has been after the fact ) , then we should also have received a credit for no longer buying from mpc ( the other side of the deal ,
deal # 549160 ) . we should only lose $ 40 ( the net difference ) . any ideas ?

virgina and bill :
during our month - end processes i have researched deal # 549162 . 1 . the counterparty did change as bill pointed out , but what makes you suffer a loss in the prior month adjustments was due to the volume being zeroed out for he 3 . originally the deal liquidated with he 3 ( 40 mwh * $ 135 ) , he 4 ( 15 mwh * $ 135 ) , and he 5 ( 20 mwh * $ 135 ) , but on 4 / 19 / 2001 the volume for he 3 was zeroed out in scheduling , which means originally you were given too much $ for the sale and therefore we are now taking that revenue you made in he 3 back .
thanks ,

i have one question on this month ' s pma and some questions from last month . first , for deal # 549162 , this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty tacomasupp . this counterparty was then changed to tacomapubuit . why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue ? are we being charged for each counterparty again ( like ees and st - cali last month ) , if so , we need to fix this flawed tool .
second , for last month , we determined that the wbom book needs a $ 108 , 000 pma for change in price . the appropriate price is in enpower , but the revenue has never appeared ( deal # 590753 ) . remember , this deal was originally input as a buy at $ 320 and a sell at $ 30 and liquidated at these prices . the deal is now at $ 320 and $ 300 . what do we need to do to get this trued up ?
please come see me with questions .
thank you for your help .

Se esse acordo foi zerado (e foi depois do fato), também deveríamos ter recebido um crédito por não comprar mais do MPC (o outro lado do acordo,

Virginia,
Eu tenho uma pergunta sobre a PMA deste mês e algumas perguntas do mês passado Primeiro, para o acordo # 549162, este acordo foi originalmente feito incorretamente como contraparte tacomasupp Esta contraparte foi então alterada para Tacomapubuit Por que uma mudança na contraparte resulta em uma perda de receita? Estamos sendo cobrados por cada contraparte novamente (como EES e ST - Cali no mês passado), se sim, precisamos consertar essa ferramenta defeituosa Segundo, no mês passado, determinamos que o livro WBOM precisa de um PMA de US $ 108.000 para a mudança de preço O preço apropriado está no enoder, mas a receita nunca apareceu (Deal # 590753) Lembre -se, este acordo foi originalmente inserido como compra a US $ 320 e uma venda a US $ 30 e liquidou a esses preços O acordo está agora em US $ 320 e US $ 300 O que precisamos fazer para aumentar isso?

from microbes to plants and animals blurring the boundaries between species we are moving rapidly into the post darwinian era when the rules of open source sharing will be extended from the exchange

we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and file for claims for his money as the heir , because we cannot release the funds from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next of kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines .
unfortunately , neither his family member nor distant relative has ever appeared to claim the said funds . upon this discovery , i and other officials in my department agreed that with your assistance we can work out an arrangement and write an application for claims on your behalf and make you the next of kin . we will process all the necessary documents to ensure that the funds is released into your accountas the heir of the fund no one has come forth for any claims as he died with all the members of his family and if nothing is done soon , the funds will be returned to the banks treasury as unclaimed fund and the bank will confiscate the funds and that will be the end .
however , we have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus , 30 % for you as foreign partner , 60 % for us the officials in my department and 10 % for the settlement of all local and foreign expenses incurred by us in the course of this business . upon the successful completion of this transfer , i and one of my colleagues will come to your country to take care of our share . it is from our 60 % we intend to inevest on any viable business venture as a way of recycling the fund .
to commence this transaction , we require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return e - mail and enclose your private contact telephone number , fax number full name and address and your designated bank coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate department for neccessary approvals before the transfer can be made .
note also , this transaction must be kept strictly confidential because of its nature .
i look forward to receiving your prompt response .

the paradox of
stress
there is a level of genius in every human being
and it is called a ' gift ' . stress however plays a huge role in how
we deliver it to the world . the mystery is that stress is a good
thing when used properly and a bad thing when misused . how can
that be ? consider these get me thru points about
stress . i learned about them the hard way . you don ' t have to make my
mistakes .
stress is a process in life and not just a
thing that happens
stress literally enters your being daily and
it must also be shown the exit door daily
stress should be utilized as a tool for
forward movement in the face of challenge
stress keeps you alert at the beginning ,
weighs on you midway and brings you down in the end if you keep it
to long
stress is an excellent motivator but unlike
motivation , it doesn ' t just disappear
a get me thru nugget of wisdom : wherever
you store your stress is where you can expect to experiencethe
most damage , physically , spiritually or financially . . . in the end ,
someoneelse most likely will have to inform you about the
severity of your damage .
a
get me thru question : do you process your stress daily for
authentic success or do you store it daily for
disaster ?
so you see the parameters of
stress will enter the board room or home , it has no preference . -
it ' s all about people and not position . however , when ignored stress
will ultimately determine how far each one of us goes in life -
guaranteed !
read what i learned about how to
process stress and how misusing it nearly cost me my life in chapter
8 of "" the voice
of my boundaries "" .
the coach ' s play of the
month : "" motivation excites
you about someone else ' s answers . inspiration
ignites your inner
strength through questions thatlead you to successful actions

the get me thru question for this
month should last you for a lifetime , because stress is a part of
life forever . whether you want to be a millionaire or merely
survive , you too must make a decision about processing stress . your
success in life demands it !

Momento comercial de Venita
Especial mensal
o paradoxo de
estresse
há um nível de gênio em todo ser humano
E é chamado de 'presente' estresse, no entanto, desempenha um grande papel em como
Nós entregamos ao mundo O mistério é que o estresse é um bom
coisa quando usada corretamente e uma coisa ruim quando mal utilizada Como pode
isso é? Considere estes me levar a pontos sobre
estresse Eu aprendi sobre eles da maneira mais difícil você não tem que fazer meu
erros O estresse é um processo na vida e não apenas um
coisa que acontece
o estresse literalmente entra no seu ser diário e
Também deve ser mostrado a porta de saída diariamente
O estresse deve ser utilizado como uma ferramenta para
movimento para a frente diante do desafio
O estresse mantém você alerta no começo,
pesa em você no meio do caminho e o derruba no final, se você mantê -lo
para muito tempo
O estresse é um excelente motivador, mas diferentemente
motivação, não desaparece
A Get Me Thru Nugget of Wisdom: onde quer que
Você armazena seu estresse é onde você pode esperar experimentar
mais danos, fisicamente, espiritual ou financeiramente   no fim ,
Alguém provavelmente terá que informá -lo sobre o
Gravidade do seu dano um
Faça -me uma pergunta: você processa seu estresse diariamente para
sucesso autêntico ou você o armazena diariamente para
Desastre?
Então você vê os parâmetros de
O estresse entrará na sala de diretoria ou em casa, não tem preferência -
É tudo sobre pessoas e não posicionar No entanto, quando ignorado estresse
Em última análise, determinará até que ponto cada um de nós vai na vida -
Garantido!
Leia o que aprendi sobre como
Processar o estresse e o quão indevido isso quase me custou minha vida no capítulo
8 de ""The Voice
dos meus limites "" o jogo do treinador do
mês: ""Motivação excita
você sobre as respostas de outra pessoa inspiração
acende seu interior
Força através de perguntas que você lyra para ações bem -sucedidas
e consciência da auto -consciência ""
o me dando uma pergunta para isso
o mês deve durar por toda a vida, porque o estresse faz parte de
vida para sempre se você quer ser um milionário ou apenas
sobreviver, você também deve tomar uma decisão sobre o processamento do estresse seu
O sucesso na vida exige isso!

0,this week on the perl escapenumber mailing lists developers shouldn't live in fear of o jerry gay in 'use of english pragma ' language second perl escapenumber microgrant phil crow on java to perl escapenumber declaration converter leon brocard announced that the second perl escapenumber microgrant had been awarded to phil crow for his proposal to convert java declarations to perl escapenumber more information about his proposal can be found in the grant application text details about the microgrant application procedure are available for those interested in submitting a proposal sescapenumber typo jonathan lang submitted a patch which corrects a typo in sescapenumber sescapenumber range semantics jonathan lang suggested a change to sescapenumber which was inspired by the new array indexing syntax from sescapenumber this would make ranges in an array index a natural outgrowth of the standard range semantics sescapenumber negation metaoperator jonathan lang had a proposal to generalize the negated relational operators to apply to any infix operator which returns a boolean larry wall rejected the suggestion because the relationals jonathan named are typed to return any not bool parrot porters perl escapenumber patch make disassemble useful kevin tew created ticket perl escapenumber with a patch and requested feedback back in july of escapenumber paul cochrane applied it as rescapenumber on april escapenumberst perl escapenumber bug failures in escapenumber tests during 'make test' partially patched james keenan created ticket perl escapenumber to report errors on escapenumber different tests later he closed the ticket because the failing tests were identified as part of ongoing work and the tests were no longer failing perl escapenumber cage run parrot under coverity prevent paul cochrane wanted to get coverity to run prevent on parrot this was ticket perl escapenumber more recently paul reported that he'd received a reply stating that parrot could certainly be added but that no date estimate was available at the moment syntax for constructing new objects and classes this thread began with klaas jan stol asking about the syntax for constructing new objects because he thought that it was going to be changed allison randal replied with examples of the two proposals for the new syntax this led alek storm to ask if new would be a vtable method or a pccmethod jonathan worthington confirmed that it is a pccmethod allison elaborated that it is a class method more recently alek replied that he thought that new should be kept an opcode and new should be a vtable method which is called from inside the new opcode jonathan worthington was confused by alek's proposal he suggested making baseclass implement all the vtable variants of a method and class can inherit from it and provide a sane interface alek thought that jonathan's suggestion was similar to one he had made in perl escapenumber but that jonathan's explanation was superior allison also added her thoughts to this subthread in the main thread jonathan proposed deprecating the old syntax in the next release and removing support for it in the following release allison agreed to marking it as deprecated now joshua isom wanted the dot syntax to still work so that tests wouldn't need to be rewritten allison explained that there were several reasons to remove constants for types and the class registry compilers pirc continued klaas jan stol added a vtable to the parser in compilers pirc he proposed looking at the bcg project to see if it would fit in with compilers pirc allison randal thought it was worth exploring svn parrot pdd rescapenumber trunk docs pdds draft a commit by allison randal integrated some questions and comments into the objects pdd jonathan worthington had a few comments such as noting that resolve is sugar rather than something new and that comments about offsets should go away allison noted that resolve is the preferred way of dealing with conflict resolution and removed references to offsets perl escapenumber extensive failures in t compilers imcc imcpasm t and t pmc sub t james keenan posted some failures in make test in ticket perl escapenumber paul cochrane reported that he was unable to replicate the failures with rescapenumber and asked james to check his revision james looked into it further and concluded that the name of the sandbox was affecting the test results he wondered if anyone could explain why that was happening svn parrot pdd rescapenumber trunk docs pdds a commit by paul cochrane noted that perl code with end or data blocks should not get an emacs or vim coda shawn m moore suggested putting the coda at the top of the file but paul explained that this had been attempted but proved to be a poor solution for several reasons perl escapenumber cage work out how to encourage good editor independent formatting habits paul cochrane created ticket perl escapenumber with the mission figure out how to encourage good formatting habits without assuming that everyone uses emacs or vim and with minimal clutter in our source code also write a coding standards test to codify this perl escapenumber cage generated files with timezoneless times in ticket perl escapenumber will coleda wanted tools which insert messages into generated files to include a timezone which should always be utc paul cochrane said that generated files are checked for timestamps in codingstd gmt utc t and that config init defaults pm was updated in rescapenumber to pass the test perl escapenumber cage add a perl critic policy to look for fixme todo xxx in ticket perl escapenumber paul cochrane suggested adding a check for 'fixme' 'todo' etc for the perl source files as there is currently only a check for the c files this was done in rescapenumber chris dolan suggested using an existing perl critic policy will coleda asked if andy lester would accept a patch which would optionally permit 'todo' comments which included ticket numbers and reject those which don't include ticket numbers andy replied that he didn't want to build exceptions and proposed that people just write 'rt escapenumber' instead of 'todo escapenumber ' paul cochrane agreed with this suggestion link'n'load on windows ron blaschke reported that he was looking into errors in linking and loading on windows with linking there were some symbols which weren't exported he planned to provide a patch to export them to solve the loading issue he wanted to change several files to include the full path current state of building parrot on cygwin ron blaschke reminded the list that it is necessary to include the absolute path to blib lib in the path environment variable to build on cygwin he also explained that some problems could be due to a file having windows line endings eric hanchrow wondered if it was possible to make parrot less fussy about the line endings ron wanted to see that happen but explained that his suggestions were workarounds until the problem was resolved steve peters said he would be looking at how to improve the process ron described his thoughts in more detail in 'link'n'load on windows ' chromatic asked if it was possible to pass flags to the linker to hint at the path which is how the linux version works ron thought that was handy but hadn't seen something similar for windows perl escapenumber patch configure pl refactor options processing functionality in ticket perl escapenumber james keenan posted a patch which removes command line option processing from configure pl and puts it in a library this was done to make testing easier the patch was applied as rescapenumber and escapenumber perl escapenumber patch borland c cleanups in ticket perl escapenumber steve peters submitted a patch which cleans up parrot for borland c on windows this patch does not completely solve compilation issues because it seems to create new issues on linux chromatic applied it as rescapenumber hash iteration question jonathan worthington showed two examples of iterating through a hash and noted that in his first example you will only get the first key in the hash he believes that the hash and iterator code are closely tied and isn't thread safe allison randal replied that the significant differences are down to the iterator's shift pmc throwing an exception if the key is escapenumber while shift string doesn't check she agreed that the code was excessively mixed and needed review leopold toetsch added a further explanation on the implementation pddescapenumber newclass jonathan worthington had a comment on pdd escapenumber and how it described the creation of a new class he wondered about the implementation allison randal replied that the newclass opcode will be a simple opcode jonathan implemented what allison described and created a test for it as well perl escapenumber bug pmcescapenumberc pl does anyone know how to use the 'no body' option in ticket perl escapenumber james keenan noted that nobody had spoken up in favor of retaining the no body option he said that he would take the ticket and assign the revisions to participants of the perl seminar phalanx phoneix project in ny perl escapenumber patch parrot cleanups part escapenumber steve peters submitted a patch in ticket perl escapenumber which had some cleanups to make parrot work better with different c compilers it was applied as rescapenumber paper on software patterns in parrot klaas jan stol mentioned that he had recently taken a course on software patterns and co authored a paper on patterns in parrot which he put on the wiki perl escapenumber cage parrot pmcescapenumberc pccmethod constants should be autogenerated jerry gay noted that lib parrot pmcescapenumberc pccmethod pm contains a number of constants which should be generated during the configure process and included ticket perl escapenumber discusses this request perl escapenumber todo mmd needs to be in a pdd jonathan worthington wanted multi method dispatch to be documented in one of the pdds or get its own pdd the request was made in ticket perl escapenumber perl escapenumber todo modify pccmethod syntax to more closely match pddescapenumber in ticket perl escapenumber jerry gay requested that the pccmethod syntax be modified to put it in line with pdd escapenumber chromatic offered a patch svn ci nci methods now name mangled jonathan worthington explained that he was starting to move class functionality into vtable methods but ran into the issue that you cannot have a method or pccmethod with the same name as a vtable method this is however required to implement the interface specified in pdd escapenumber he made some changes to get parrot working again which affected the complex pmc fran cescapenumber aescapenumberois perrad reported that this change breaks lua allison ran dal observed the same thing and asked jonathan to either fix the problem for lua or revert the change from the trunk jonathan apologized for breaking things and said that it was fixed in rescapenumber leopold toetsch suggested that perhaps language maintainers who are using features of parrot could submit core tests for these features so that this type of problem won't occur in the future joshua isom thought this could be expanded to anyone using parrot where a feature isn't tested he proposed an open repository for tests chromatic wondered if it was that difficult to mail in patches joshua offered some arguments in favor of it chromatic parrotcode updates will coleda solicited for suggestions concerning parrotcode org because the current system requires that he do quite a bit of work every time that directories are moved or files are added he proposed having a directory on the site which is a checked in version of the docs html directory after a make html he also suggested having docs for the latest release as well as for the 'svn head' perl escapenumber t doc pod t vs tools doc pod errors pl in ticket perl escapenumber will coleda suggested removing the script tools doc pod errors pl because the functionality is already replicated in t doc pod t also the script finds errors which the test does not which requires investigation joshua isom reported that he got a segmentation fault when he tried to run the script when he persisted with running it he found that it appeared to have a stricter pod checker jerry gay thought that perhaps the script and the test were checking different files paul cochrane found that on gentoo the t codingstd c indent t test caused perl to segfault but with a new perl compilation it worked he was curious because he wondered if the error was due to gentoo perl joshua replied that he was using darwin paul also remarked that the script reported where the errors were in the file which the test didn't do jerry gay and nicholas clark commented on this fwd yapc europe call for hackathons james e keenan reposted a call for hackathons which was published for yapc europe escapenumber he felt that the chicago hackathon had been good for parrot and hoped that someone would lead a related hackathon at y e more information about the offer can be found on the y e website re perl escapenumber autoreply p symbolic register allocation bug yehoshua sapir remarked that the code in perl escapenumber worked on os x perl escapenumber patch t pmc sub t test for creation of lex by clone op yehoshua sapir submitted ticket perl escapenumber which contains a patch to test the creation of lex by the clone op perl escapenumber patch configure pl move stdout messages to parrot configure messages james keenan created ticket perl escapenumber to submit a patch which makes lib parrot configure messages pm output messages to stdout previously this was done by configure pl this will make testing easier it was applied as rescapenumber svn parrot pdd rescapenumber in trunk docs pdds docs pdds draft allison randal made a commit which moved pdd escapenumber objects out of the draft directory use of english pragma james e keenan noted that configure pl uses one of the english variables namely output autoflush he wondered if there was a policy regarding the use of the named variables instead of their short versions jerry gay felt that it was wrong to use the english variables james said he would convert the variable while refactoring he created ticket perl escapenumber to remind him of this task later this was done and applied as rescapenumber svn ci pmc documentation guidelines draft jerry gay remarked that he had committed a draft of pmc documentation guidelines in rescapenumber the document is meant to explain the style of documentation which should be used for core pmcs klaas jan stol had some additions borrowed from 'perl best practices' joshua isom questioned klaas jan on some of the points and klaas jan elaborated perl escapenumber src pmc os pmc bad use of stat escapenumber and lstat escapenumber in ticket perl escapenumber the output of t pmc os t which fails on solaris escapenumber was attached perl escapenumber improper casting to void in src dynext c ticket perl escapenumber

more information about his proposal can be found in the grant application text details about the microgrant application procedure are available for those interested in submitting a proposal sescapenumber typo jonathan lang submitted a patch which corrects a typo in sescapenumber sescapenumber range semantics jonathan lang suggested a change to sescapenumber which was inspired by the new array indexing syntax from sescapenumber this would make ranges in an array index a natural outgrowth of the standard range semantics sescapenumber negation metaoperator jonathan lang had a proposal to generalize the negated relational operators to apply to any infix operator which returns a boolean larry wall rejected the suggestion because the relationals jonathan named are typed to return any not bool parrot porters perl escapenumber patch make disassemble useful kevin tew created ticket perl escapenumber with a patch and requested feedback back in july of escapenumber paul cochrane applied it as rescapenumber on april escapenumberst perl escapenumber bug failures in escapenumber tests during 'make test' partially patched james keenan created ticket perl escapenumber to report errors on escapenumber different tests later he closed the ticket because the failing tests were identified as part of ongoing work and the tests were no longer failing perl escapenumber cage run parrot under coverity prevent paul cochrane wanted to get coverity to run prevent on parrot this was ticket perl escapenumber more recently paul reported that he'd received a reply stating that parrot could certainly be added but that no date estimate was available at the moment syntax for constructing new objects and classes this thread began with klaas jan stol asking about the syntax for constructing new objects because he thought that it was going to be changed allison randal replied with examples of the two proposals for the new syntax this led alek storm to ask if new would be a vtable method or a pccmethod jonathan worthington confirmed that it is a pccmethod allison elaborated that it is a class method more recently alek replied that he thought that new should be kept an opcode and new should be a vtable method which is called from inside the new opcode jonathan worthington was confused by alek's proposal he suggested making baseclass implement all the vtable variants of a method and class can inherit from it and provide a sane interface alek thought that jonathan's suggestion was similar to one he had made in perl escapenumber but that jonathan's explanation was superior allison also added her thoughts to this subthread in the main thread jonathan proposed deprecating the old syntax in the next release and removing support for it in the following release allison agreed to marking it as deprecated now joshua isom wanted the dot syntax to still work so that tests wouldn't need to be rewritten allison explained that there were several reasons to remove constants for types and the class registry compilers pirc continued klaas jan stol added a vtable to the parser in compilers pirc he proposed looking at the bcg project to see if it would fit in with compilers pirc allison randal thought it was worth exploring svn parrot pdd rescapenumber trunk docs pdds draft a commit by allison randal integrated some questions and comments into the objects pdd jonathan worthington had a few comments such as noting that resolve is sugar rather than something new and that comments about offsets should go away allison noted that resolve is the preferred way of dealing with conflict resolution and removed references to offsets perl escapenumber extensive failures in t compilers imcc imcpasm t and t pmc sub t james keenan posted some failures in make test in ticket perl escapenumber paul cochrane reported that he was unable to replicate the failures with rescapenumber and asked james to check his revision james looked into it further and concluded that the name of the sandbox was affecting the test results he wondered if anyone could explain why that was happening svn parrot pdd rescapenumber trunk docs pdds a commit by paul cochrane noted that perl code with end or data blocks should not get an emacs or vim coda shawn m moore suggested putting the coda at the top of the file but paul explained that this had been attempted but proved to be a poor solution for several reasons perl escapenumber cage work out how to encourage good editor independent formatting habits paul cochrane created ticket perl escapenumber with the mission figure out how to encourage good formatting habits without assuming that everyone uses emacs or vim and with minimal clutter in our source code also write a coding standards test to codify this perl escapenumber cage generated files with timezoneless times in ticket perl escapenumber will coleda wanted tools which insert messages into generated files to include a timezone which should always be utc paul cochrane said that generated files are checked for timestamps in codingstd gmt utc t and that config init defaults pm was updated in rescapenumber to pass the test perl escapenumber cage add a perl critic policy to look for fixme todo xxx in ticket perl escapenumber paul cochrane suggested adding a check for 'fixme' 'todo' etc for the perl source files as there is currently only a check for the c files this was done in rescapenumber chris dolan suggested using an existing perl critic policy will coleda asked if andy lester would accept a patch which would optionally permit 'todo' comments which included ticket numbers and reject those which don't include ticket numbers andy replied that he didn't want to build exceptions and proposed that people just write 'rt escapenumber' instead of 'todo escapenumber ' paul cochrane agreed with this suggestion link'n'load on windows ron blaschke reported that he was looking into errors in linking and loading on windows with linking there were some symbols which weren't exported he planned to provide a patch to export them to solve the loading issue he wanted to change several files to include the full path current state of building parrot on cygwin ron blaschke reminded the list that it is necessary to include the absolute path to blib lib in the path environment variable to build on cygwin he also explained that some problems could be due to a file having windows line endings eric hanchrow wondered if it was possible to make parrot less fussy about the line endings ron wanted to see that happen but explained that his suggestions were workarounds until the problem was resolved steve peters said he would be looking at how to improve the process ron described his thoughts in more detail in 'link'n'load on windows ' chromatic asked if it was possible to pass flags to the linker to hint at the path which is how the linux version works ron thought that was handy but hadn't seen something similar for windows perl escapenumber patch configure pl refactor options processing functionality in ticket perl escapenumber james keenan posted a patch which removes command line option processing from configure pl and puts it in a library this was done to make testing easier the patch was applied as rescapenumber and escapenumber perl escapenumber patch borland c cleanups in ticket perl escapenumber steve peters submitted a patch which cleans up parrot for borland c on windows this patch does not completely solve compilation issues because it seems to create new issues on linux chromatic applied it as rescapenumber hash iteration question jonathan worthington showed two examples of iterating through a hash and noted that in his first example you will only get the first key in the hash he believes that the hash and iterator code are closely tied and isn't thread safe allison randal replied that the significant differences are down to the iterator's shift pmc throwing an exception if the key is escapenumber while shift string doesn't check she agreed that the code was excessively mixed and needed review leopold toetsch added a further explanation on the implementation pddescapenumber newclass jonathan worthington had a comment on pdd escapenumber and how it described the creation of a new class he wondered about the implementation allison randal replied that the newclass opcode will be a simple opcode jonathan implemented what allison described and created a test for it as well perl escapenumber bug pmcescapenumberc pl does anyone know how to use the 'no body' option in ticket perl escapenumber james keenan noted that nobody had spoken up in favor of retaining the no body option he said that he would take the ticket and assign the revisions to participants of the perl seminar phalanx phoneix project in ny perl escapenumber patch parrot cleanups part escapenumber steve peters submitted a patch in ticket perl escapenumber which had some cleanups to make parrot work better with different c compilers it was applied as rescapenumber paper on software patterns in parrot klaas jan stol mentioned that he had recently taken a course on software patterns and co authored a paper on patterns in parrot which he put on the wiki perl escapenumber cage parrot pmcescapenumberc pccmethod constants should be autogenerated jerry gay noted that lib parrot pmcescapenumberc pccmethod pm contains a number of constants which should be generated during the configure process and included ticket perl escapenumber discusses this request perl escapenumber todo mmd needs to be in a pdd jonathan worthington wanted multi method dispatch to be documented in one of the pdds or get its own pdd the request was made in ticket perl escapenumber perl escapenumber todo modify pccmethod syntax to more closely match pddescapenumber in ticket perl escapenumber jerry gay requested that the pccmethod syntax be modified to put it in line with pdd escapenumber chromatic offered a patch svn ci nci methods now name mangled jonathan worthington explained that he was starting to move class functionality into vtable methods but ran into the issue that you cannot have a method or pccmethod with the same name as a vtable method this is however required to implement the interface specified in pdd escapenumber he made some changes to get parrot working again which affected the complex pmc fran cescapenumber aescapenumberois perrad reported that this change breaks lua allison ran dal observed the same thing and asked jonathan to either fix the problem for lua or revert the change from the trunk jonathan apologized for breaking things and said that it was fixed in rescapenumber leopold toetsch suggested that perhaps language maintainers who are using features of parrot could submit core tests for these features so that this type of problem won't occur in the future joshua isom thought this could be expanded to anyone using parrot where a feature isn't tested he proposed an open repository for tests chromatic wondered if it was that difficult to mail in patches joshua offered some arguments in favor of it chromatic parrotcode updates will coleda solicited for suggestions concerning parrotcode org because the current system requires that he do quite a bit of work every time that directories are moved or files are added he proposed having a directory on the site which is a checked in version of the docs html directory after a make html he also suggested having docs for the latest release as well as for the 'svn head' perl escapenumber t doc pod t vs tools doc pod errors pl in ticket perl escapenumber will coleda suggested removing the script tools doc pod errors pl because the functionality is already replicated in t doc pod t also the script finds errors which the test does not which requires investigation joshua isom reported that he got a segmentation fault when he tried to run the script when he persisted with running it he found that it appeared to have a stricter pod checker jerry gay thought that perhaps the script and the test were checking different files paul cochrane found that on gentoo the t codingstd c indent t test caused perl to segfault but with a new perl compilation it worked he was curious because he wondered if the error was due to gentoo perl joshua replied that he was using darwin paul also remarked that the script reported where the errors were in the file which the test didn't do jerry gay and nicholas clark commented on this fwd yapc europe call for hackathons james e keenan reposted a call for hackathons which was published for yapc europe escapenumber he felt that the chicago hackathon had been good for parrot and hoped that someone would lead a related hackathon at y e more information about the offer can be found on the y e website re perl escapenumber autoreply p symbolic register allocation bug yehoshua sapir remarked that the code in perl escapenumber worked on os x perl escapenumber patch t pmc sub t test for creation of lex by clone op yehoshua sapir submitted ticket perl escapenumber which contains a patch to test the creation of lex by the clone op perl escapenumber patch configure pl move stdout messages to parrot configure messages james keenan created ticket perl escapenumber to submit a patch which makes lib parrot configure messages pm output messages to stdout previously this was done by configure pl this will make testing easier it was applied as rescapenumber svn parrot pdd rescapenumber in trunk docs pdds docs pdds draft allison randal made a commit which moved pdd escapenumber objects out of the draft directory use of english pragma james e keenan noted that configure pl uses one of the english variables namely output autoflush he wondered if there was a policy regarding the use of the named variables instead of their short versions jerry gay felt that it was wrong to use the english variables james said he would convert the variable while refactoring he created ticket perl escapenumber to remind him of this task later this was done and applied as rescapenumber svn ci pmc documentation guidelines draft jerry gay remarked that he had committed a draft of pmc documentation guidelines in rescapenumber the document is meant to explain the style of documentation which should be used for core pmcs klaas jan stol had some additions borrowed from 'perl best practices' joshua isom questioned klaas jan on some of the points and klaas jan elaborated perl escapenumber src pmc os pmc bad use of stat escapenumber and lstat

the plan was part of a major overhaul announced by the company on wednesday . though the company has not specifically announced which assets it will divest in the next two quarters , eads included these locations on the short list :

kevin ,
per your request , please see below :
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
new facsimile machine information
please take a look @ the following and let me know , which fax machine you
choose or if you need information on something smaller , then i will have the
vendor contact you directly to finalise installation . an enron director or
above { with signature authority to legally bind enron to a contract } will
have to sign off on the contract paperwork before the fax machine can be
installed . delivery times on new machines are normally 3 - 5 working days but
either vendor listed below will be able to provide a "" loaner "" should you have
a business need . please discuss the fax machine install date with the rep
when ordering the equipment .
if there is no existing fax line present , you will need to send a notes - mail
to the move team { erica @ x 3 - 3185 or janelle @ x 5 - 7917 } requesting the
installation of a new fax line . the move team can be found in the notes - mail
"" ect address book "" .
if you are an ees employee , you must first get new equipment approval from
ees budget control . contact susan mcleroy @ x 5 - 8066 or via notes - mail .
if you are an ebs employee , you must first get new equipment approval from
ebs purchasing & budget control . contact paula corey @ x 3 - 9948 or martha
reyna @ x 3 - 3491 . you can reach both of these people via notes - mail .
if you are an ena employee , you must first get new equipment approval from
ena finance & budget control . contact lorie belsha @ x 3 - 9617 or via
notes - mail .
a note on the fax machines listed below :
all the machines listed below come with a 2 nd paper tray and upgraded memory
{ maxed by model ~ see below } as an enron standard from each vendor .
all the fax machines listed below have a modem speed rated @ 33 . 6 kbps versus
the canon laserclass 7500 { example only } @ 14 . 4 kbps = new fax machine should
be noticeably quicker .
document feeder capacity of the machines listed below are the same as the
canon laserclass 7500 { example only }
maintenance = models listed below have maintenance / repair coverage included
in monthly $ total . there is no separate agreement ! toner / drum cartridges +
paper + line charges are extra { not quoted }
contract pricing can change without warning , so please let me know asap if a
vendor quotes you a different price to those listed below against the various
models .
if the fax machine is to be used in a trading type environment , here are some
considerations :
no more than 20 people per fax machine = take a look @ the fax machine
placement on eb 30 or eb 31 .
disregard any fax machine that does not have a 33 . 6 k modem and jbig
compression { or equivalent } .
look for memory upgrades & 2 nd paper tray included in monthly cost . { models
quoted are loaded } .
maintenance is to be included in monthly cost { models quoted are covered } .

the above machines are designed for workgroup use .
q ) how many people will be using this fax machine ?
q ) how much usage will this fax machine have ?
{ i . e . heavy = 40 faxes per day @ 20 pages / 60 faxes per day @ 2 - 3 pages or a
lot less ? if "" heavy "" , either the pb 2050 , pb 9930 or uf 885 / uf 895 should fit
your needs = if 15 - 40 , the pb 9830 would probably be a better fit }
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

in order to quantify some empirical deliverables to assess enron ' s management capabilities of retaining top performers and removing lower tiered performers , this sub - committee has outlined the following assignments to be completed for ebs , ena , ets , enron europe and enron corp . by the may 14 meeting :
? using year - end prc results , get the composition of the number of individuals per performance category , disaggregated between commercial and commercial support
? assuming that these individuals are in the same prc categories , assessment of the number of individuals retained per performance category as of may , 2001
? for the employees that left a particular business unit , was the discharge involuntary or voluntary ( left to another firm or another enron business unit )
by gathering this empirical evidence , this management sub - committee can address the following questions :
? how effective were enron managers in removing lower tiered ( needs improvement / issues ) employees ?
? did lower tiered performers reallocate themselves to other business units ( i . e . . , reaffirming the myth that there is a subset of employees that exist "" below the radar screen "" and consistently job - hop ) ?
? have enron managers successfully retained top performers from the 2000 prc process ?
other questions that we would like to answer , but will be limited by existing prc historical ratings are :
? for those individuals rated satisfactory and below , what have been their performance ratings in the past ?
? how many superior or excellent candidates have left over the past five years ?
we wanted to send this email to highlight the need to acquire this prc data quickly from our human relations representatives . we wish to acquire the data in aggregate form , separated by performance category , work function ( commercial vs . commercial support ) and voluntary or involuntary egress from enron . the responsibility for acquiring this information by each enron business unit is as follows :
? ena - jean mrha
? ets - shelley corman
? ebs - kelly kimberly
? enron europe - richard lewis
? enron corp . - gregory adams
if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact me .

Para quantificar alguns entregas empíricas para avaliar os recursos de gerenciamento da Enron de reter os melhores desempenhos e remover os artistas de camadas mais baixas, este sub -comitê descreveu as seguintes tarefas a serem concluídas para EBS, ENA, ETS, Enron Europe e Enron Corp Na reunião de 14 de maio:
? Usando os resultados do ano final, obtenha a composição do número de indivíduos por categoria de desempenho, desagregados entre suporte comercial e comercial
? Supondo que esses indivíduos estejam nas mesmas categorias de RPC, avaliação do número de indivíduos retidos por categoria de desempenho a partir de maio de 2001
? Para os funcionários que deixaram uma unidade de negócios específica, foi a descarga involuntária ou voluntária (deixada para outra empresa ou outra unidade de negócios da Enron)
Ao reunir esta evidência empírica, esse sub -gerenciamento pode abordar as seguintes perguntas:
? Qual a eficácia dos gerentes da Enron na remoção de funcionários de camadas mais baixas (precisa de melhorias / problemas)?
? Os artistas de camadas mais baixos se realocam para outras unidades de negócios (i e  , reafirmando o mito de que existe um subconjunto de funcionários que existem ""abaixo da tela do radar"" e o trabalho constantemente - salto)?
? Os gerentes da Enron mantiveram com sucesso os melhores desempenhos do processo de 2000 da RPC?
Outras perguntas que gostaríamos de responder, mas serão limitadas pelas classificações históricas da RPC existente:
? Para os indivíduos classificados satisfatórios e abaixo, quais foram suas classificações de desempenho no passado?
? Quantos candidatos superiores ou excelentes sobraram nos últimos cinco anos?
Queríamos enviar este e -mail para destacar a necessidade de adquirir esses dados da RPC rapidamente de nossos representantes de relações humanas Desejamos adquirir os dados em forma agregada, separados pela categoria de desempenho, função de trabalho (comercial vs suporte comercial) e saída voluntária ou involuntária da Enron A responsabilidade de adquirir essas informações por cada unidade de negócios da Enron é a seguinte:
? Ena - Jean Mrha
? ETS - Shelley Corman
? EBS - Kelly Kimberly
? Enron Europa - Richard Lewis
? Enron Corp - Gregory Adams

there are two databases which i cannot locate :
west realtime
wscc outages
however , i did locate :
real time operations : ectpdx - lnl / ect \ realtime \ myaccoun . nsf ( would this be the correct database ? )
realtime : ecthou - ln 7 / ect \ mail \ realtime . nsf
for wscc outages and west realtime databases , if you could locate someone who does have access to these databases and ask them to do the following :
close the database icon
right - click on the database icon
choose file , database , properties
then send me the title , server , and filename information . this will be of great help .
many thanks and please advise .

Obrigado por analisar isso e por sua resposta rápida Não tenho certeza de quais bancos de dados você está olhando (possivelmente em tempo real do leste?), Mas eu anexei uma lista dos quatro bancos de dados que os novos comerciantes em tempo real de Portland precisam acessar a Os nomes dos comerciantes são: Darin Presto; João c Anderson; Michael Mier Obviamente, sua necessidade de uma conta de lotus notas está implícita nesta solicitação Além disso, eles precisam do seguinte:
Título - interrupções no WSCC
Servidor - ECTPDX - LNL / ECT
Nome do arquivo - Mail \ WSCCNET NSF
Título - West Real Time
Servidor - ECTPDX - LNL / ECT
nome do arquivo - Mail \ Westreal NSF
Título - Arquivo de agendamento de Power West
Servidor - Ecthou _ lnl / ect
nome do arquivo - Power \ Powrschdiarchive NSF
Título - Discussão de agendamento de Power West
Servidor - Ecthou _ lnl / ect
Nome do arquivo - Power \ Powrschdi NSF
Mais uma vez, obrigado por sua ajuda com isso, e por favor me avise se há algo que eu possa fazer para ajudar obrigado ,

Existem dois bancos de dados que não consigo localizar:
West Real Time
interrupções do WSCC
No entanto, eu localizei:
Operações em tempo real: ECTPDX - LNL / ECT \ RealTime \ MyAccoun NSF (este seria o banco de dados correto?)
tempo real: ecthou - ln 7 / ect \ Mail \ RealTime NSF
Para interrupções no WSCC e bancos de dados em tempo real do West Real, se você pudesse localizar alguém que tenha acesso a esses bancos de dados e peça que eles façam o seguinte:
Feche o ícone do banco de dados
Direita - clique no ícone do banco de dados
Escolha arquivo, banco de dados, propriedades
Em seguida, envie -me o título, o servidor e as informações do nome do arquivo Isso será de grande ajuda Muito obrigado e por favor, aconselhe Lisa Scully"

based on your meeting with kevin and dave earlier today , i understand you would like a breakdown of the expenditures expected to develop a texas coal plant to the point that it can be monetized .
the below is my best estimate for developing the brownsville site to get to the monetization point ( permits in hand and epc contract signed ) . i expect to have both an epc contract and permits in hand some time around sep ' 02 if we start with the expenditures in mid july ' 01 . expenditures will be incurred at the rate of approximately $ 350 , 000 per month for the next 12 months . we can back out at any time with only prompt month plus one additional month committed .
costs for a florida site will be similar ; however , expenditures will not start until we achieve site control .
my recommendation is to start fully developing the brownsville , tx site with a plan to flip the site once we have a permit , as market conditions warrant . i recommend holding off on significant expenditures in florida until we get more comfortable with site control .

Com base em sua reunião com Kevin e Dave hoje cedo, entendo que você gostaria de um colapso das despesas que devem desenvolver uma usina de carvão do Texas a ponto de poder ser monetizado O abaixo é a minha melhor estimativa para o desenvolvimento do site de Brownsville para chegar ao ponto de monetização (permissões em mãos e contrato de EPC assinado) Espero ter um contrato de EPC e licenças em mãos em algum momento de setembro 02 Se começarmos com as despesas em meados de julho '01 As despesas serão incorridas à taxa de aproximadamente US $ 350.000 por mês nos próximos 12 meses Podemos voltar a qualquer momento com apenas um mês rápido, mais um mês adicional comprometido Os custos para um site da Flórida serão semelhantes; No entanto, as despesas não começarão até alcançarmos o controle do local Minha recomendação é começar a desenvolver totalmente o site de Brownsville, TX, com um plano para virar o site assim que tivermos uma permissão, conforme as condições do mercado justificam Eu recomendo adiar gastos significativos na Flórida até ficarmos mais confortáveis ​​com o controle do local Mitch

0,"welcome back , again . you will have to let me know when you have baby pictures in the office - would love to see them .
last week , i orchestrated some changes within my operations organization which will free up more of my time to focus on the successful commercialization of mid and back office services . i have asked bob hall to lead operations for enron americas , with peggy hedstrom ( calgary operations ) , jeff gossett ( gas risk and south america operations ) , stacey white ( power risk ) and leslie reeves ( confirmations and settlements ) reporting directly to him . he is enthusiastic about the additional responsibility and i believe that he will do an excellent job for enron americas .
other changes include appointing kevin sweeney as head of operations for eim , with brenda herod reassigned as part of a project team that will work on the ees assimilation . i have also asked beth apollo to play a project management lead role in the assimilation of ees into ews .
i will be glad to fill you in on more details on any of these changes . the result is to give more responsibility to several key players - stretching them , but i will be there to support and coach them in their new roles if needed . plus , i can now devote significantly more time to the commercialization effort . in that regard , i did move to the 27 th floor ( next to piper ) while you were out on leave .
i wanted to share these changes with you before a memo goes out across the organization next monday . call me if you would like to discuss . - - sally","Bem -vindo de volta, de novo Você terá que me avisar quando tiver fotos de bebê no escritório - adoraria vê -las Na semana passada, orquestrei algumas mudanças na minha organização de operações que liberarão mais do meu tempo para se concentrar na comercialização bem -sucedida de serviços médios e de back office Pedi a Bob Hall para liderar operações da Enron Americas, com Peggy Hedstrom (operações de Calgary), Jeff Gossett (risco de gás e operações da América do Sul), Stacey White (risco de energia) e Leslie Reeves (confirmações e assentamentos) relatando diretamente para ele Ele está entusiasmado com a responsabilidade adicional e acredito que ele fará um excelente trabalho para a Enron Americas Outras mudanças incluem nomear Kevin Sweeney como chefe de operações da EIM, com Brenda Herod reatribuída como parte de uma equipe de projeto que trabalhará na assimilação do EES Eu também pedi a Beth Apollo para desempenhar um papel de líder de gerenciamento de projetos na assimilação de EES na EWS Terei o maior prazer em preenchê -lo sobre mais detalhes sobre qualquer uma dessas mudanças O resultado é dar mais responsabilidade a vários jogadores -chave - esticando -os, mas estarei lá para apoiá -los e treiná -los em seus novos papéis, se necessário Além disso, agora posso dedicar significativamente mais tempo ao esforço de comercialização Nesse sentido, mudei para o 27º andar (ao lado de Piper) enquanto você estava de licença Eu queria compartilhar essas mudanças com você antes que um memorando sai pela organização na próxima segunda -feira me ligue se quiser discutir - - Sally"

subject : optical network engineering & enron research offsite meeting
hi john , as per our discussion and e - mails , i am suggesting the following
dates for the subject offsite : april 14 & 15 th ( friday & sat ) . place and
agenda to follow once this date is nailed up . the heads of each group will
decide who will attend . we would also invite kevin hannon , scott yeager , tom
gros , ted seitz and jean mrha once the dates and agenda are agreed upon by
the technical folks .
as before , the idea is to introduce the two of the most technical groups
within enron and to exchange ideas and issues . the enron research team will
provide trading and modeling presentations and the optical network
engineering team will present networking and components related topics .
take away from the two days will be to provide john griebling ' s group with
better understanding about how the trading markets have developed in general
and energy markets in particular via enron ( i . e . , how the sausage was
made ! ) . likewise , john ' s group will provide us with better understanding of
optical networking from a technical perspective . particularily , how ebs is
planning to develop the puplic switched optical network ( pson ) that john has
' branded ' our pooling point based network !
please reply asap if these two days ( april 14 & 15 ) will work . additionally ,
john , is the original suggestion to hold it in scott yeager ' s cabin somewhere
up in colorado mts . still holds ? if yes , i should probably let scott know !
if not , i ' ll try to find other places - - any suggestions , anyone ?

Assunto: Engenharia de rede óptica e Reunião de pesquisa de Enron
Oi John, de acordo com nossa discussão e e -mails, estou sugerindo o seguinte
Datas para o assunto externo: 14 e 15 de abril (sexta -feira e sáb) lugar e
Agenda a seguir assim que esta data for acertada as cabeças de cada grupo vão
Decida quem vai comparecer Também convidamos Kevin Hannon, Scott Yeager, Tom
Gros, Ted Seitz e Jean Mrha depois que as datas e a agenda são acordadas por
as pessoas técnicas Como antes, a idéia é apresentar os dois dos grupos mais técnicos
dentro da Enron e trocar idéias e questões A equipe de pesquisa da Enron irá
fornecer apresentações de negociação e modelagem e a rede óptica
A equipe de engenharia apresentará tópicos relacionados a redes e componentes afaste -se dos dois dias será fornecer ao grupo de John Griebling
Melhor entendimento sobre como os mercados comerciais se desenvolveram em geral
e mercados de energia em particular via Enron (i e , como a salsicha foi
feito ! ) Da mesma forma, o grupo de John nos fornecerá uma melhor compreensão de
Redes ópticas de uma perspectiva técnica particularmente, como o EBS é
planejando desenvolver a rede óptica comutada em pó (PSON) que John tem
'Marcado' nossa rede baseada em pontos de pool!
Responda o mais rápido possível se esses dois dias (14 e 15 de abril) funcionarão adicionalmente ,
John, é a sugestão original para segurá -la na cabine de Scott Yeager em algum lugar
no Colorado MTS Ainda se mantém? Se sim, eu provavelmente deveria deixar Scott saber!
Caso contrário, tentarei encontrar outros lugares - - alguma sugestão, alguém?
cumprimentos ,

talking to the staff in london , i heard that lynda clemmons and a few of the
key weather desk members left to start their own business . i am hearing that
london may gain more independence from houston and gain its own book and ,
interestingly , also having ideas about developing the insurance / insurance
derivatives market . i therefore thought this might be a useful opportunity
to formalise a gradual transfer of responsibility for weather deal pricing
from joe to myself plus start talking to vasant about the new markets on the
insurance side . i will call you later to discuss this with you .
regards ,

Conversando com a equipe de Londres, ouvi dizer que Lynda Clemmons e alguns dos
Os principais membros do Weather Desk foram embora para iniciar seu próprio negócio Estou ouvindo isso
Londres pode ganhar mais independência de Houston e ganhar seu próprio livro e,
Curiosamente, também ter idéias sobre como desenvolver o seguro / seguro
mercado de derivativos Portanto, pensei que essa poderia ser uma oportunidade útil
Para formalizar uma transferência gradual de responsabilidade pelo preço do acordo climático
De Joe a mim mesmo, além de começar a conversar com Vasant sobre os novos mercados no
lado do seguro Vou ligar para você mais tarde para discutir isso com você cumprimentos ,

thanks for your response . apparently , we were under the incorrect impression
that your group would be taking li ( based on jeff ' s note below ) . we
apologize for not contacting you last friday to confirm prior to "" placing "" li
in your group . i have faxed li ' s resume to you and hope that you will have
time to review it today . please call me back as soon as you can to discuss
li ' s opportunities in your group .
if vince is not interested in li for his group , we will consider li placed in
ena - gas trading ( original placement ) in john lavorato ' s organization . once
i hear from vince one way or the other , the program will consider li ' s
placement final in either research or ena - gas trading . hopefully this will
be resolved by tuesday morning so that we may communicate to li her rotation
information . if you have any questions , please let me know .

jeff","Vince,
Obrigado pela sua resposta Aparentemente, estávamos sob a impressão incorreta
que seu grupo levaria Li (com base na nota de Jeff abaixo) nós
Peça desculpas por não entrar em contato com você na sexta -feira passada para confirmar antes de ""colocar"" li
em seu grupo Eu enviei o currículo de Li por fax para você e espero que você tenha
Hora de revisá -lo hoje por favor me ligue de volta o mais rápido possível para discutir
As oportunidades de Li em seu grupo Se Vince não estiver interessado em Li para seu grupo, consideraremos Li colocado em
ENA - Negociação de gás (colocação original) na organização de John Lavorato uma vez
Eu ouço de Vince de um jeito ou de outro, o programa considerará Li's
Posicionamento final na pesquisa ou na ENA - Negociação de gás Espero que isso vá
ser resolvido até terça -feira de manhã para que possamos nos comunicar com sua rotação
Informação Se você tiver alguma dúvida, por favor me avise obrigado !

i sent revisions to the faq ' s and the cover letter to kal shah and
leslie hansen last night . kal assures me that all of the changes i
suggested ( including the deletion of any mention of ubswenergy other
than as part of a web address ) were being made . accordingly , i think
the message is getting through . also , in conversations with mark
taylor , i stressed that no trademark registration was to be made ,
pointing out that the use of the url was intended to be temporary .
mark had not had anything to do with a possible registration of the
mark , other than receiving a phone mail message .
we will see how things go , however , i believe the message has gotten
through for now .

the broader issue perhaps is that they appear to be naming / branding
the
on - line trading system ubswenergy and using that as a marketing name
for their business . for example , i had heard they wanted to
trademark
the term . even if they have approval to use the website name
temporarily , does it make sense to go out with a marketing name that
might be killed in 6 months - and for which we may not have approval
to
trademark ? maybe not a popular position if costas is behind this -
but
we should be sure everyone is clear on the possible ramifications .
just so you know , there are some intellectual property considerations
behind this . in order to best protect the ubs and ubs warburg names ,
group does not like us to weaken them by using ubsw .

dnso - ext . ubswenergy . com 192 . 216 . 57 . 100
dnsl - ext . ubswenergy . com 192 . 216 . 57 . 101
it is entirely possible that the names dnso - ext . ubswenergy . com
and dnsl - ext . ubswenergy . com will be rejected because the
ip addresses associated with those names are already associated with
dnso - ext . enrononline . com and dnsl - ext . enrononline . com . if this is
the case , it will be necessary to use the enrononline . com domain
names
for the dns servers and then change the server names later , once
ubswenergy is on - line and ready . as long as the servers provide
information about both domains , this should be possible .

A questão mais ampla talvez seja que eles parecem estar nomeando / branding
o
ON - Sistema de negociação de linha Ubswenergy e usando isso como um nome de marketing
para seus negócios Por exemplo, eu tinha ouvido falar que eles queriam
marca registrada
O termo Mesmo que eles tenham aprovação para usar o nome do site
temporariamente, faz sentido sair com um nome de marketing que
pode ser morto em 6 meses - e pelo qual podemos não ter aprovação
para
marca registrada? Talvez não seja uma posição popular se Costas estiver por trás disso -
mas
Devemos ter certeza de que todos estão claros sobre as possíveis ramificações Só para você saber, existem algumas considerações de propriedade intelectual
por trás disso Para melhor proteger os nomes do UBS e UBS Warburg,

Assunto: Ubswenergy com: Mudança de servidores autoritários
É crucial que os servidores DNS para Ubswenergy com ser definido como
segue (o mais rápido possível):
DNSO - ext Ubswenergy com 192 216 57 100
DNSL - ext Ubswenergy com 192 216 57 101
É inteiramente possível que os nomes DNSO - ext Ubswenergy com
e DNSL - ext Ubswenergy com será rejeitado porque o
endereços IP associados a esses nomes já estão associados a
DNSO - ext Enrononline com e dnsl - ext Enrononline com Se isso é
O caso, será necessário usar a enrononline domínio com
nomes
para os servidores DNS e depois altere os nomes do servidor posteriormente, uma vez
ubswenergy está ligado - linha e pronta desde que os servidores forneçam
informações sobre os dois domínios, isso deve ser possível JD

escapenumber reaction from public health aids organizations to democratic leadership bush administration announcement on trade policy on friday may escapenumber the house democratic leadership and the bush administration announced an agreement on trade issues including patent and access to medicines related provisions of trade agreements with peru and panama we remain concerned that while some first steps have been taken to lessen the harm of u s trade agreements it is still the case that if passed by congress these trade agreements with peru and panama will restrict rather than expand access to lifesaving medicines the first thing that must be said about the agreement is nothing definitive can be said until more details emerge and final textual amendments are presented in the case of trade agreements details and specificity are of crucial importance a better process would have involved a transparent discussion of key issues and an opportunity for more structured input and comment on unfolding details from members of congress and the public that better process could only have yielded a better outcome on the substance it appears the democratic leadership has taken some first steps to make u s trade agreements less harmful to public health it is not true as some news accounts have suggested that the may escapenumber deal will limit brand name drug companies' patent and related monopolies in a best case scenario what the deal will do is limit the extent to which u s trade agreements expand brand name drug companies' monopolies however arguing about how to make trade deals less harmful is the wrong framework when it comes to public health the united states should aspire to a higher standard first and at minimum to do no harm and second to use international agreements to address access to medicines efficient innovation of medical technologies and other pressing global public health priorities trade agreements modified in accord with the may escapenumber

medicines for all the democratic leadership was not able to eliminate all of the life threatening provisions in u s trade agreements which themselves build on a world trade organization framework that is already heavily biased to favor big pharma for example the preservation of data exclusivity alone is a gigantic gift to big pharma data exclusivity rules preventing generics from relying on clinical test data from brand name companies is big pharma's top agenda item for trade deals and a major impediment to generic competition in addition the reported time limits and exceptions to data exclusivity announced on may escapenumber may be narrower than initially reported moreover it is very dangerous to give any additional latitude to an administration that has shown itself to operate in bad faith on access to medicines issues just last month ustr placed thailand on the priority watch list for lawfully issuing compulsory licenses formal rights preserved in free trade agreements are of limited value if ustr is going to apply informal pressure use the special escapenumber process and coerce countries during trade agreement implementation phases all to undermine access to medicines initiatives developing countries should be free from agreements and ustr pressures that restrict their rights to use all available flexibilities for accessing more affordable generic medicines to meet

america once had the clarity of the pioneer ax .
everywhere i have sought rest and not found it , except sitting in a corner by myself with a little book .
a vigorous temper is not altogether an evil . men who are easy as an old shoe are generally of little worth .
no comment is a splendid expression . i am using it again and again .
tomorrow , you promise yourself , will be different , yet , tomorrow is too often a repetition of today .
colleges don ' t make fools , they only develop them .
this grandiose tragedy that we call modern art .
some folks won ' t look up until they are flat on their backs
under socialism all will govern in turn and will soon become accustomed to no one governing .
christmas waves a magic wand over this world , and behold , everything is softer and more beautiful .
one cannot walk through an assembly factory and not feel that one is in hell .
if an angel were ever to tell us anything of his philosophy i believe many propositions would sound like 2 times 2 equals 13 .
a bore is a man who , when you ask him how he is , tells you .
a diplomat is a person who can tell you to go to hell in such a way that you actually look forward to the trip .
nothing wilts faster than laurels that have been rested upon .
in the fight between you and the world , back the world .
the simple lack of her is more to me than others presence .
the best way to know god is to love many things .
the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams .

América uma vez teve a clareza do machado pioneiro Em todos os lugares que procurei descanso e não o encontrei, exceto sentado em um canto sozinho com um pequeno livro Um temperamento vigoroso não é totalmente um mal Homens que são fáceis como um sapato antigo geralmente são de pouco valor Nenhum comentário é uma expressão esplêndida Estou usando de novo e de novo Amanhã, você promete a si mesmo, será diferente, mas amanhã é muitas vezes uma repetição de hoje as faculdades não fazem tolos, eles apenas os desenvolvem Esta tragédia grandiosa que chamamos de arte moderna Algumas pessoas não vão olhar para cima até ficarem planas nas costas
Sob o socialismo, todos governarão por sua vez e em breve se acostumarão com ninguém que governe O Natal acena uma varinha mágica sobre este mundo, e eis que tudo é mais suave e mais bonito Não se pode caminhar por uma fábrica de montagem e não sentir que alguém está no inferno Se um anjo nos dissesse algo de sua filosofia, acredito que muitas proposições soariam como 2 vezes 2 é igual a 13 Um furo é um homem que, quando você pergunta como ele é, diz a você Um diplomata é uma pessoa que pode dizer para você ir para o inferno de tal maneira que você realmente aguarde a viagem nada murcha mais rápido que louros que foram descansados Na luta entre você e o mundo, de volta ao mundo A simples falta dela é mais para mim do que os outros presentes A melhor maneira de saber Deus é amar muitas coisas O futuro pertence àqueles que acreditam na beleza de seus sonhos "

thanks for the note about dave . i do not know dave but will probably pay him a visit in boston to see what we might do with them . acitivity out of their northeast office has primarily been on the nat gas side , but with their recent acquistion of central hudson ' s generation assets in ny they have been getting more active in power .
i have been meaning to swing by and introduce myself on one of my trips to houston , and will be sure to do so on the next trip .

Obrigado pela nota sobre Dave Eu não conheço Dave, mas provavelmente farei uma visita a Boston para ver o que podemos fazer com eles A acitividade fora de seu escritório no nordeste está principalmente no lado do NAT Gas, mas com a recente aquisição dos ativos de geração do centro de Hudson em NY, eles estão ficando mais ativos no poder Eu pretendo passar e me apresentar em uma das minhas viagens a Houston, e certamente farei isso na próxima viagem cumprimentos

my understanding from legal was that corporate development as represented by donahue and the business unit had to sign off . he brought mordaunt into the picture for his legal side . i don ' t like going outside of ea anymore than you do , but according to established policy relayed to me through legal stand still and non - solicitation language requires this type of sign off .

we have a little over a week to get a preliminary , non - binding bid in , if the original schedule holds , and we have held off as long as we can signing any language along these lines , but we are now starting to be backed against the wall . this language represents the best we are going to be able to accomplish in this situation .

7 % private market value discount remains

good morning ,
attached , please find the latest issue of our independent power weekly .
summary :
1 . ipps rise 5 . 0 % last week our ipp composite rose 5 . 0 % , outperforming the
s & p 500 ( + 1 . 6 % ) and the nasdaq ( + 3 . 8 % ) . aes corp ( aes ) , which was up 22 . 2 % ,
was the strongest generator in the group followed by reliant resources ( rri )
which rose 11 . 0 % . orion power ( orn ) was the weakest performer , rising 1 . 2 % .
2 . generation oriented utilities fall 2 . 8 % our universe of
generation - oriented utilities fell 2 . 8 % , in - line with the uty ( - 2 . 5 % ) .
black hills ( bkh ) , cleco ( cnl ) and constellation energy ( ceg ) all rose less
than 1 % . allegheny energy was the weakest performer , down 7 . 6 % .
3 . ene / dyn + attractive valuations boost stock prices last week was the
3 rd consecutive week of positive stock price performance for the group .
driving stock prices higher , investors continued to grow more comfortable
with the enron situation following confirmation of dynegy ' s intention to
acquire enron and provide immediate liquidity support by investing $ 1 . 5
billion . further , we believe the group simply remains oversold . the pure
play power producers are trading at a 7 % average discount to their private
market asset values .
4 . notes from mirant meeting mirant hosted an upbeat analyst meeting last
tuesday . mir reiterated that 80 % of its 2002 forecast is supported by
earnings from hedged ( generation and natural gas ) and franchise businesses
( distribution ) . mir also provided an in - depth review of how it accounts for
its risk management activities . management noted that it could maintain its
credit rating without any new equity issuance over the next 12 months .
however , it would be eager to access the equity market should conditions
improve in the near - term .
5 . power market update last week the us power markets were generally weak
across the country owing to mild weather and falling natural gas prices .
while the mirant national power index fell 17 . 1 % last week , the natural gas
week composite spot price fell 23 . 2 % . spark spreads improved in the
northeast and texas , while compressing in california and the southeast .
6 . debt market update credit spreads tightened across the sector last week
due to diminished ene concerns and positive stock price performance .

on success ive orbits to land in florida and three opportunities to land at edwards a ir force base calif the first edwards opportunity comes on the same orbit as the second florida opportunity and conditions in california are expecte d to be go but the wind likely will kick up later in the day and it woul d appear sturckow's best chance for getting home today is the first opportu nity in

is to build tests that use functions like all equal to escapenumber compare data structures it is also easy to maintain tests in the face escapenumber of change e g with a new version of s plus or with bug fixes to escapenumber functions or with changed database contents i use ediff in emacs to escapenumber compare test output with the stored annotated transcript and can usually escapenumber

secondly , we have an existing outsourcing agreement with startech energy for volumes totaling 8 - 10 mmcf / d . these properties have been purchased by a company called arc . the existing msa for startech properties is being terminated and a new agreement covering all of arc ' s production is in the final stages of negotiation . starting in may / june , the volumes under this new arrangement will be between 50 - 60 mmcf / d . this increased volume and associated receipt points creates the need to add one person to the logistics group . this position was not budgeted for , however , i have received approval from rob milnthorp to add this position . please let me know if you have any concerns about this net staff addition .

urgent assistance .
you may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . i am mr . desmond stevens , the first son of dr . dennis stevens , who was recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe . i was furnished with viable information from the world trade centre here in amsterdam , the netherlands and decided to write you .
before the death of my father , he had taken me to amsterdam to deposit the sum of ten million , five hundred thousand united states dollars ( us $ 10 , 500 , 000 ) in a security company , as if he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe . this money was deposited in a box as gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company . this amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of new farm in swaziland . this land problem came when zimbabwe president mr . robert mugabe , introduced a new land act that wholly affected rich white farmers and some few black farmers . this resulted to the killing and mob action by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society . infact , a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act of which my father was one of the victims . it is against this background that my family and i who are currently staying in amsterdam decided to transfer my father  s money to
a foreign account . since the law of the netherlands prohibit a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to open any account or to be involved in any financial transaction .
as the eldest son of my father , i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands for the fear of going through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history . moreover , the netherlands foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment from asylum seekers . as a businessman , whom i have entrusted my future and my family in his hands , i must let you know that this transaction is risk free . if you accept to assist me and my family , all i need you to do for me is to make arrangement and come to amsterdam , the netherlands so that you can open the non - resident account which will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nominate overseas . this money i intend to use for investment . i have
options to offer you , first you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for the transaction , or you can go into partnership with me for a proper profitable investment of the money in your country . whichever option you choose , feel free to notify me . i have mapped out 5 % of this money for all expenses incurred in processing this transaction . if you do not prefer a partnership , i am willing to give you 25 % of the money while the remaining 70 % that is meant for me , will be for the investment in your country .
please , contact me with the above telephone and e - mail address , while i implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in the transaction .
yours faithfully ,
desmond stevens .

assistência urgente Você pode se surpreender ao receber esta carta minha, já que você não me conhece pessoalmente Eu sou o sr Desmond Stevens, o primeiro filho de Dr. Dennis Stevens, que foi assassinado recentemente na disputa de terras no Zimbábue Fui fornecido com informações viáveis ​​do World Trade Center aqui em Amsterdã, na Holanda e decidi escrever para você Antes da morte de meu pai, ele me levou a Amsterdã para depositar a quantia de dez milhões, quinhentos mil dólares dos Estados Unidos (US $ 10, 500.000) em uma empresa de segurança, como se ele previu o perigo iminente no Zimbábue Esse dinheiro foi depositado em uma caixa como pedras preciosas para evitar muita demurração da empresa de segurança Esse valor foi destinado à compra de novas máquinas e produtos químicos para as fazendas e o estabelecimento de uma nova fazenda na Suazilândia Esse problema da terra ocorreu quando o presidente do Zimbábue Robert Mugabe, apresentou uma nova Lei de Terras que afetou totalmente os ricos agricultores brancos e alguns agricultores negros Isso resultou na ação de assassinato e multidão pelos veteranos de guerra do Zimbábue e alguns lunáticos na sociedade De fato, muitas pessoas foram mortas por causa desta Lei de Reforma Andicórteja da qual meu pai era uma das vítimas É nesse histórico que minha família e eu que estão atualmente em Amsterdã decidimos transferir o dinheiro do meu pai para
uma conta estrangeira Como a lei da Holanda proíbe um refugiado (requerente de asilo) para abrir qualquer conta ou estar envolvido em qualquer transação financeira Como filho mais velho de meu pai, estou com a responsabilidade de buscar uma conta estrangeira genuína, onde esse dinheiro poderia ser transferido sem o conhecimento do meu governo que está empenhado em levar tudo o que temos Estou confrontado com o dilema de investir essa quantia de dinheiro na Holanda por medo de passar pela mesma experiência no futuro, já que os dois países têm história semelhante Além disso, a política de câmbio da Holanda não permite esse investimento de requerentes de asilo Como empresário, a quem confiei meu futuro e minha família em suas mãos, devo informar que essa transação é livre de risco Se você aceita ajudar a mim e à minha família, tudo o que preciso para mim é fazer um arranjo e vir para Amsterdã, na Holanda, para que você possa abrir a conta não residente que nos ajudará a transferir o dinheiro para qualquer conta que você nomeará no exterior Este dinheiro que pretendo usar para investimento eu tenho
Opções para oferecer a você, primeiro você pode optar por ter certa porcentagem do dinheiro para nomear sua conta para a transação, ou pode entrar em parceria comigo para um investimento adequado lucrativo do dinheiro em seu país Qualquer que seja a opção que você escolher, fique à vontade para me notificar Eu mapeei 5 % desse dinheiro para todas as despesas incorridas no processamento desta transação Se você não preferir uma parceria, estou disposto a lhe dar 25 % do dinheiro enquanto os 70 % restantes que são para mim, serão para o investimento em seu país Entre em contato comigo com o telefone e e -mail acima, enquanto eu imploro que você mantenha o sigilo absoluto necessário na transação Atenciosamente,
Desmond Stevens - -

interested in my new role , working with you . fernley has decided that it is
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects
all of the people who reported in to phillip and i , so he has just verbally
announced the changes . but , at any rate , the word is getting out .
i hadn ' t seen mo in months , so it was good to catch up . i think she is
headed to houston this week ( so is frank ) so i am sure you will be hearing
from her .
i have tentatively blocked out the week beginning monday , nov . 13 th to come
over to houston , and would like to spend some of that time with you and your
team , meeting people , and maybe just following you around for the day , as you
suggested .
does that week work for you ? i think the management conference is later in
the month , so people will generally be around .
please let me know , and i will make sure it happens . i will also need to
spend some time with melissa becker and her team working on post ase
reporting solutions , but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with
the north america group .
what do you think ? i am ready to get moving on some new things ! ! ! !

É muito difícil anotar todas as mudanças organizacionais e como isso afeta
Todas as pessoas que se relataram em Phillip e eu, então ele acabou de
anunciou as mudanças Mas, de qualquer forma, a palavra está saindo Eu não tinha visto mo há meses, então era bom conversar Eu acho que ela é
ia a Houston esta semana (assim é franco), então tenho certeza de que você estará ouvindo
dela Eu timbativamente bloqueei a semana a partir de segunda -feira, novembro 13 para vir
até Houston, e gostaria de passar parte desse tempo com você e seu
equipe, conhecer pessoas, e talvez apenas seguindo você para o dia, como você
sugerido Essa semana funciona para você? Eu acho que a conferência de gerenciamento está mais tarde
o mês, então as pessoas geralmente estarão por perto por favor me avise, e vou garantir que isso aconteça Eu também vou precisar
Passe algum tempo com Melissa Becker e sua equipe trabalhando no post ASE
relatar soluções, mas planejará gastar uma quantidade significativa de tempo com

liz ,
i work for anthony dayao as part of the ees it group but formerly was in enron net works under steve stock and met louise briefly in 1999 . i ' m in the middle of the rice university executive mba program and for one of our final exam questions , we are permitted to consult internal resources . the question is regarding how we ( enron ) have used the internet to differentiate ourselves from other organizations ( competitors ) in the industry . during our rice mba classes , eol was brought up several times so it ' s considered very highly by the school . i would be remiss if i didn ' t mention its strengths during our exam .
my professor has provided me assurance in writing ( email ) that any answer will not be published .
i appreciate louise ' and your time in helping me on this school exam paper .

Liz,
Trabalho para Anthony Dayao como parte do grupo EES de TI, mas anteriormente estava na Enron Net Works sob Steve Stock e se encontrou brevemente em Louise em 1999 Estou no meio do programa de MBA executivo da Rice University e, para uma de nossas perguntas finais, temos permissão para consultar recursos internos A questão é sobre como nós (Enron) usamos a Internet para nos diferenciar de outras organizações (concorrentes) no setor Durante nossas aulas de MBA de Rice, a EOL foi criada várias vezes, por isso é considerado muito bem pela escola Eu seria negligente se não mencionei seus pontos fortes durante o exame Meu professor me forneceu garantia por escrito (e -mail) de que qualquer resposta não será publicada Agradeço Louise 'e seu tempo em me ajudar neste documento de exame escolar cumprimentos ,
